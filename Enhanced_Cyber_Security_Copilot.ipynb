        "#### Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Task\n",
        "Develop a co-pilot for threat researchers, security analysts, and professionals that addresses the limitations of current AI solutions like ChatGPT and Perplexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Current Challenges\n",
        "1. **Generic Data**: Existing AI solutions provide generic information that lacks specificity.\n",
        "2. **Context Understanding**: These solutions fail to understand and maintain context.\n",
        "3. **Limited Information**: The data sources are often limited and not comprehensive.\n",
        "4. **Single Source Dependency**: Relying on a single source of information reduces reliability and accuracy.\n",
        "5. **Inadequate AI Models**: Current models do not meet the specialized needs of cybersecurity professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Requirement\n",
        "Create a chatbot capable of collecting and curating data from multiple sources, starting with search engines, and expanding to website crawling and Twitter scraping.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### Technical Specifications\n",
        "- **No Hallucinations**: Ensure the chatbot provides accurate and reliable information.\n",
        "- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Use RAG to determine which connectors to use based on user inputs.\n",
        "- **Query Chunking and Distribution**: Optimize the process of breaking down queries and distributing them across different sources.\n",
        "- **Data Curation Steps**:\n",
        "  1. Collect links from approximately 50 sources.\n",
        "  2. Aggregate data from websites and Twitter.\n",
        "  3. Curate data using a knowledge graph to find relationships and generate responses.\n",
        "- **Chatbot Capabilities**: Answer queries such as:\n",
        "  - \"List all details on {{BFSI}} security incidents in {{India}}.\"\n",
        "  - \"List all ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare industry in {{last 7 days/last 3 months/last week/last month}}.\"\n",
        "  - \"Provide recent incidents related to Lockbit Ransomware gang / BlackBasta Ransomware.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Goal\n",
        "Develop a data collector that integrates multiple specific sources to enrich the knowledge base, enabling the model to better understand context and deliver accurate results. The solution should be modular, allowing customization and configuration of sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Summary\n",
        "The goal is to build an advanced, modular chatbot for cybersecurity professionals that overcomes the limitations of existing AI solutions by integrating multiple data sources and ensuring context-aware, accurate responses. The chatbot will utilize state-of-the-art techniques like RAG and knowledge graphs to provide comprehensive, curated information from diverse sources.\n"

Heap-based Buffer Overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)\\n\\nCVSS Source: Microsoft\\n\\nCVSS:3.1 8.8 / 7.7\\n\\n_\\ue946_Base score metrics: 8.8 / Temporal score metrics:

metrics(8)\\n\\nAttack Vector\\n\\nThis metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component.\\n\\nLocal\\n\\nThe vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)\\n\\nAttack Complexity\\n\\nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration.\\n\\nLow\\n\\nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component.\\n\\nPrivileges Required\\n\\nThis metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.\\n\\nLow\\n\\nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources.\\n\\nUser Interaction\\n\\nThis metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.\\n\\nNone\\n\\nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user.\\n\\nScope\\n\\nDoes a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component.\\n\\nChanged\\n\\nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.\\n\\nConfidentiality\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.\\n\\nAvailability\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).\\n\\n_\\ue8ec_\\n\\n_\\ue974_\\n\\nTemporal score metrics(3)\\n\\nExploit Code Maturity\\n\\nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, public availability of exploit code, or active, \\'in-the-wild\\' exploitation.\\n\\nUnproven\\n\\nNo publicly available exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical.\\n\\nRemediation Level\\n\\nThe Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final.\\n\\nOfficial Fix\\n\\nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available.\\n\\nReport Confidence\\n\\nThis metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers.\\n\\nConfirmed\\n\\nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability.\\n\\nPlease see [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss)\\n for more information on the definition of these metrics.\\n\\nExploitability\\n--------------\\n\\nThe following table provides an [exploitability assessment](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/exploitability-index)\\n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication.\\n\\nPublicly disclosed\\n\\nNo\\n\\nExploited\\n\\nNo\\n\\nExploitability assessment\\n\\nExploitation More Likely\\n\\nFAQ\\n---\\n\\n**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**\\n\\nAn authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application that would give them control of the targeted destination and source of the copy.\\n\\n**What privileges could be gained by an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability?**\\n\\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges.\\n\\n**According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?**\\n\\nThis vulnerability could lead to a contained execution environment escape.

Heap-based Buffer Overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)\\n\\nCVSS Source: Microsoft\\n\\nCVSS:3.1 8.8 / 7.7\\n\\n_\\ue946_Base score metrics: 8.8 / Temporal score metrics:

metrics(8)\\n\\nAttack Vector\\n\\nThis metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component.\\n\\nLocal\\n\\nThe vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker’s path is via read/write/execute capabilities. Either: the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document)\\n\\nAttack Complexity\\n\\nThis metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration.\\n\\nLow\\n\\nSpecialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component.\\n\\nPrivileges Required\\n\\nThis metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.\\n\\nLow\\n\\nThe attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources.\\n\\nUser Interaction\\n\\nThis metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.\\n\\nNone\\n\\nThe vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user.\\n\\nScope\\n\\nDoes a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component.\\n\\nChanged\\n\\nAn exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.\\n\\nConfidentiality\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact.\\n\\nIntegrity\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.\\n\\nAvailability\\n\\nThis metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component.\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nThere is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).\\n\\n_\\ue8ec_\\n\\n_\\ue974_\\n\\nTemporal score metrics(3)\\n\\nExploit Code Maturity\\n\\nThis metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, public availability of exploit code, or active, \\'in-the-wild\\' exploitation.\\n\\nUnproven\\n\\nNo publicly available exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical.\\n\\nRemediation Level\\n\\nThe Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final.\\n\\nOfficial Fix\\n\\nA complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available.\\n\\nReport Confidence\\n\\nThis metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers.\\n\\nConfirmed\\n\\nDetailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability.\\n\\nPlease see [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss)\\n for more information on the definition of these metrics.\\n\\nExploitability\\n--------------\\n\\nThe following table provides an [exploitability assessment](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/exploitability-index)\\n for this vulnerability at the time of original publication.\\n\\nPublicly disclosed\\n\\nNo\\n\\nExploited\\n\\nNo\\n\\nExploitability assessment\\n\\nExploitation More Likely\\n\\nFAQ\\n---\\n\\n**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**\\n\\nAn authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application that would give them control of the targeted destination and source of the copy.\\n\\n**What privileges could be gained by an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability?**\\n\\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges.\\n\\n**According to the CVSS metric, a successful exploitation could lead to a scope change (S:C). What does this mean for this vulnerability?**\\n\\nThis vulnerability could lead to a contained execution environment escape.

The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials. This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0. The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy\\'s logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer\\'s default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to \"Cluster\" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren\\'t known to be exposed. 2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3. 3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2. 3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it\\'s imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses. | 2024-03-12 | [8.2](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2022-34321&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2022-34321](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2022-34321)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://lists.apache.org/thread/ods5tq2hpl390hvjnvxv0bcg4rfpgjj8)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2022-34321/) |\\n| apache\\\\_software\\\\_foundation -- apache\\\\_pulsar | Improper input validation in the Pulsar Function Worker allows a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary Java code on the Pulsar Function worker, outside of the sandboxes designated for running user-provided functions.

These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren\\'t properly validated, contain special elements like \"..\", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\". This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3. 3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3. 3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

The supported URL schemes include \"file\", \"http\", and \"https\". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\". This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3. 3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3. 3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: \"additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns\" and \"additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns\". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation. | 2024-03-12 | [8.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-27894&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-27894](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-27894)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://lists.apache.org/thread/45cqhgqg8d19ongjw18ypcss8vwh206p)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27894/) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in the edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.EdgeLoginServiceImpl.doLogin() function within wizardLogin. | 2024-03-13 | [9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0799&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0799](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0799)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | A path traversal vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.servlet.ImportNodeServlet. | 2024-03-13 | [8.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0800&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0800](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0800)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | A denial of service vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in ASNative.dll. | 2024-03-13 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0801&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0801](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0801)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| argoproj -- argo-cd | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the \\\\`link.argocd.argoproj.io\\\\` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim\\'s permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD. | 2024-03-13 | [9](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28175&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28175](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28175)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/479b5544b57dc9ef767d49f7003f39602c480b71)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwv5-8mqv-g387) |\\n| autopolisbg -- bulgarisation\\\\_for\\\\_woocommerce | The Bulgarisation for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.14.

If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn\\'t send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding. Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections. The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.3 of the CoreWCF packages. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue. | 2024-03-15 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28252&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28252](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28252)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/issues/1345)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/security/advisories/GHSA-32jq-mv89-5rx7) |\\n| cyberlord92 -- web\\\\_application\\\\_firewall\\\\_-\\\\_website\\\\_security | The Malware Scanner plugin and the Web Application Firewall plugin for WordPress (both by MiniOrange) are vulnerable to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the mo\\\\_wpns\\\\_init() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.2 (for Malware Scanner) and 2.1.1 (for Web Application Firewall).

A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the \\\\`/conversation/ajax-html/send\\\\_log?folder\\\\_id=&thread\\\\_id={id}\\\\` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the \\\\`Swift\\\\_Transport\\\\_Esmtp\\\\_Auth\\\\_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()\\\\` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should adopt the following measures: 1. Avoid Storing Complete Stack Traces, 2. Implement redaction mechanisms to filter and exclude sensitive information, and 3. Review and enhance the application\\'s logging practices. | 2024-03-12 | [7.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28186&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28186](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28186)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/commit/33639a89554998dcac645613130a27ac7872605e)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7wcq-2qmv-mvcm) |\\n| givewp -- give | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (\\'Cross-site Scripting\\') vulnerability in GiveWP Give allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Give: from n/a through 3.3.1. | 2024-03-15 | [7.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-27987&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-27987](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-27987)<br>  <br>[audit@patchstack.com(link is external)](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/give/wordpress-give-plugin-3-3-1-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability?_s_id=cve) |\\n| go-vela -- worker | Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like \\\\`parameters\\\\`, \\\\`image\\\\` and \\\\`entrypoint\\\\` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and - by using common substitution string manipulation - can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the \"no commands\" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. \\\\*\\\\*To exploit this\\\\*\\\\* the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the \"no commands\" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in \\\\`parameters\\\\` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with \\\\`pull\\\\_request\\\\` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature. | 2024-03-12 | [7.7](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28236&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28236](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28236)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h) |\\n| hammadh -- play.ht\\\\_-\\\\_make\\\\_your\\\\_blog\\\\_posts\\\\_accessible\\\\_with\\\\_text\\\\_to\\\\_speech\\\\_audio | The Play.ht - Make Your Blog Posts Accessible With Text to Speech Audio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 via deserialization of untrusted input from the play\\\\_podcast\\\\_data post meta.

TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren\\'t as robust as they should be. It\\'s possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a \\\\`Command\\\\` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this isn\\'t robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2.

Unfortunately, an attacker may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary strings. For example, a request to \\\\`GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/111\\\\` will match the excluded endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection.

It\\'s possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang \\\\`#!/bin/zsh\\\\` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it\\'ll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file \\\\`$HOME/.zshenv\\\\` when the \\\\`postinstall\\\\` script is executed. An attacker could add malicious code to \\\\`$HOME/.zshenv\\\\` and it will be executed when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege on the system.

Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions. Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim\\'s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): \\\\`\\\\_\\\\_Secure-zitadel-useragent\\\\`. | 2024-03-11 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28197&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28197](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28197)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr) |\\n| zoom\\\\_video\\\\_communications,\\\\_inc. -- zoom\\\\_rooms\\\\_client\\\\_for\\\\_windows | Improper access control in the installer for Zoom Rooms Client for Windows before version 5.17.5 may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via local access. | 2024-03-13 | [7.2](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-24693&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-24693](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-24693)<br>  <br>[security@zoom.us(link is external)](https://www.zoom.com/en/trust/security-bulletin/zsb-24009/) |\\n\\nShowing 1 to 195 of 195 entries\\n\\n[Back to top](#top)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMedium Vulnerabilities\\n----------------------\\n\\nSearch:\\n\\n| Primary  <br>Vendor -- Product | Description | Published | CVSS Score | Source & Patch Info |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| aio-libs -- aiosmtpd | aiosmtpd is a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on asyncio. aiosmtpd is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling.

Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git. An improper validation bug allows users who have \\\\`create\\\\` privileges but not \\\\`override\\\\` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to upgrade.

This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.

Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some \\\\`\\\\_\\\\_destruct()\\\\` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in \\\\`$this->\\\\_keys\\\\` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->\\\\_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | 2024-03-15 | [5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28859&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28859](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28859)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/commit/edb850f94fb4de18ca53d0d1824910d6e8130166)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/security/advisories/GHSA-wjv8-pxr6-5f4r) |\\n| gacjie -- server | A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Gacjie Server up to 1.0.

A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using the helper script. | 2024-03-15 | [4](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28851&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28851](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28851)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/blob/master/scripts/add_snowflake_hive_metastore_connector_script_action.sh)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/commit/dfbf87dff456f6bb62c927711d97316f0c71d8ca)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-hive-metastore-connector/security/advisories/GHSA-r68p-g2x9-mq7x) |\\n| softaculous -- backuply\\\\_-\\\\_backup,\\\\_restore,\\\\_migrate\\\\_and\\\\_clone | The Backuply - Backup, Restore, Migrate and Clone plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.7 via the backup\\\\_name parameter in the backuply\\\\_download\\\\_backup function.

YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account, resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue has been addressed in version 1.9.0.

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active\\\\_connection\\\\_id\\\\_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID includes a value in the retire\\\\_prior\\\\_to field, which elicits a RETIRE\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer\\'s congestion window size) so that RETIRE\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem.

Anything else indicates a HW problem or fs corruption so I\\'d rather leave the extent tree as is and don\\'t try to fix it (which also means we will not create overlapping extents).\" | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47117](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47117)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/082cd4ec240b8734a82a89ffb890216ac98fec68)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48105dc98c9ca35af418746277b087cb2bc6df7c)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/569496aa3776eea1ff0d49d0174ac1b7e861e107)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b3a9a2be59478b013a430ac57b0f3d65471b071)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/920697b004e49cb026e2e15fe91be065bf0741b7)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3b668b96ad3192c0581a248ae2f596cd054792a)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8116743ef5432336289256b2f7c117299213eb9)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e33bafad30d34cfa5e9787cb099cab05e2677fcb) |\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: pid: take a reference when initializing \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\` During boot, kernel\\\\_init\\\\_freeable() initializes \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\` to the init task\\'s struct pid. Later on, we may change \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\` via a sysctl, and when this happens proc\\\\_do\\\\_cad\\\\_pid() will increment the refcount on the new pid via get\\\\_pid(), and will decrement the refcount on the old pid via put\\\\_pid(). As we never called get\\\\_pid() when we initialized \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can therefore free the init task\\'s struct pid early. As there can be dangling references to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free (e.g. when delivering signals). This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to have been around since the conversion of \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\` to struct pid in commit 9ec52099e4b8 (\"\\\\[PATCH\\\\] replace cad\\\\_pid by a struct pid\") from the pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19. Fix this by getting a reference to the init task\\'s struct pid when we assign it to \\\\`cad\\\\_pid\\\\`.

This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it can bring down the whole system via audit: 1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() can OOM kill a machine, see below details \\\\[0\\\\]. 2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc\\\\_has\\\\_perm()/slow\\\\_avc\\\\_audit() when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace\\\\_sched\\\\_switch() tracepoint, see details in \\\\[1\\\\]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like: rq\\\\_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+ trace\\\\_sched\\\\_switch() -> \\\\| bpf\\\\_prog\\\\_xyz() -> +-> deadlock selinux\\\\_lockdown() -> \\\\| audit\\\\_log\\\\_end() -> \\\\| wake\\\\_up\\\\_interruptible() -> \\\\| try\\\\_to\\\\_wake\\\\_up() -> \\\\| rq\\\\_lock(rq) --------------+ What\\'s worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check looks something like this: allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> }; However, this doesn\\'t match with the \\'current\\' task where the security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a bpf\\\\_probe\\\\_read\\\\_kernel{,\\\\_str}() helper call. The selinux\\\\_lockdown() hook does the permission check against \\'current\\', that is, httpd in this example. httpd has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall counts by user space application: bpftrace -e \\'tracepoint:raw\\\\_syscalls:sys\\\\_enter { @\\\\[comm\\\\] = count(); }\\' bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way of doing it \\\\[for the sake of the example\\\\] could be to call bpf\\\\_get\\\\_current\\\\_task() helper and then access current->comm via one of bpf\\\\_probe\\\\_read\\\\_kernel{,\\\\_str}() helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random app doing a syscall here. The BPF program \\\\_explicitly initiated\\\\_ the lockdown check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the system like my\\\\_random\\\\_tracer \\\\_not\\\\_. Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different approach for the security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() hook, that is, move the check into the program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since we\\'re moving this out of the BPF helper\\'s fast-path which can be called several millions of times per second. The check is then also in line with other security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() hooks in the system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example, open\\\\_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module\\\\_sig\\\\_check() for module signatures just to pick f ---truncated--- | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47128](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47128)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/acc43fc6cf0d50612193813c5906a1ab9d433e1e)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff40e51043af63715ab413995ff46996ecf9583f)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff5039ec75c83d2ed5b781dc7733420ee8c985fc) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: nft\\\\_ct: skip expectations for confirmed conntrack nft\\\\_ct\\\\_expect\\\\_obj\\\\_eval() calls nf\\\\_ct\\\\_ext\\\\_add() for a confirmed conntrack entry.

While at it, add a missing check to skip the template conntrack too and remove check for IPCT\\\\_UNTRACK which is implicit to !ct. | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47129](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47129)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1710eb913bdcda3917f44d383c32de6bdabfc836)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c0e6b35b88a961127066a1028bce9c727cbc3e5)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f3429c05e4028a0e241afdad856dd15dec2ffb9)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da8d31e80ff425f5a65dab7060d5c4aba749e562) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvmet: fix freeing unallocated p2pmem In case p2p device was found but the p2p pool is empty, the nvme target is still trying to free the sgl from the p2p pool instead of the regular sgl pool and causing a crash (BUG() is called).

However, the socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active, and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context. This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode. On the TX side tls\\\\_sw\\\\_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving non-decrypted packets. The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown: first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released (it used to be possible to have a tls\\\\_dev\\\\_resync after tls\\\\_dev\\\\_del). A new flag called TLS\\\\_RX\\\\_DEV\\\\_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback mode. It\\'s used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync\\\\_async, which is allocated and freed by the driver). | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47131](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47131)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0f1e6fe66977a864fe850522316f713d7b926fd9)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c55dcdd435aa6c6ad6ccac0a4c636d010ee367a4)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1d4184f128dede82a59a841658ed40d4e6d3aa2) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp: fix sk\\\\_forward\\\\_memory corruption on retransmission MPTCP sk\\\\_forward\\\\_memory handling is a bit special, as such field is protected by the msk socket spin\\\\_lock, instead of the plain socket lock.

When from other core, the section mappings are being removed for the ZONE\\\\_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs to, on which compaction is currently being operated is resulting into the kernel crash with CONFIG\\\\_SPASEMEM\\\\_VMEMAP enabled.

The commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with pfn\\\\_section\\\\_valid check\") tried to address the same problem by clearing the SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP with the expectation of valid\\\\_section() returns false thus ms->usage is not accessed. Fix this issue by the below steps: a) Clear SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP before freeing the ->usage. b) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL when SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage. c) Free the ->usage with kfree\\\\_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL. No attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP is cleared thus valid\\\\_section() return false.

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration. The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the target page\\'s ->mapping field to save \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer between page unmap and page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1. Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug, attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus proceeding to dump the page. However, page\\\\_mapping() of the target page may return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump\\\\_mapping(), since the target page->mapping only saves \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer without setting PAGE\\\\_MAPPING\\\\_ANON flag. There are seveval ways to fix this issue: (1) Setting the PAGE\\\\_MAPPING\\\\_ANON flag for target page\\'s ->mapping when saving \\'anon\\\\_vma\\', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target page has not built mappings yet. (2) Getting the page lock to call page\\\\_mapping() in \\\\_\\\\_dump\\\\_page() to avoid crashing the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page\\\\_mapping() without holding the page lock, such as compaction. (3) Using target page->private field to save the \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer and 2 bits page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove the page\\\\_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way. So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52490](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52490)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3889a418b6eb9a1113fb989aaadecf2f64964767)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9128bfbc5c80d8f4874dd0a0424d1f5fb010df1b)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1adb25df7111de83b64655a80b5a135adbded61) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_dec\\\\_device\\\\_run In mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_probe, &jpeg->job\\\\_timeout\\\\_work is bound with mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_job\\\\_timeout\\\\_work.

Address this by changing the code in question to use async\\\\_schedule\\\\_dev\\\\_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async\\\\_schedule\\\\_dev\\\\_nocall() returns false. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52498](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52498)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7839d0078e0d5e6cc2fa0b0dfbee71de74f1e557)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bd3dce27b01c51295b60e1433e1dadfb16649f7)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a1d62c775b07213c73f81ae842424c74dd14b5f0)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1c9d32c98309ae764893a481552d3f99d46cb34)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e681e29d1f59a04ef773296e4bebb17b1b79f8fe)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f46eb832389f162ad13cb780d0b8cde93641990d) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: firmware: arm\\\\_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency On reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related payload is fetched too. When an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the platform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence, any further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel to be relinquished by the platform. Once that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait for the reply to the new request starts. It has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can be wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the message header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending transaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive. This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the channel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ. Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR. | 2024-03-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52608](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52608)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12dc4217f16551d6dee9cbefc23fdb5659558cda)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/437a310b22244d4e0b78665c3042e5d1c0f45306)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/614cc65032dcb0b64d23f5c5e338a8a04b12be5d)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f95f6997f4fdd17abec3200cae45420a5489350)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b5e1b93c83ee5fc9f5d7bd2d45b421bd87774a2) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ksmbd: fix global oob in ksmbd\\\\_nl\\\\_policy Similar to a reported issue (check the commit b33fb5b801c6 (\"net: qualcomm: rmnet: fix global oob in rmnet\\\\_policy\"), my local fuzzer finds another global out-of-bounds read for policy ksmbd\\\\_nl\\\\_policy.

The purpose of the function is to update the guest\\'s AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver, then it\\'s APID will be filtered from the mdev\\'s matrix when updating the guest\\'s AP configuration. Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following: guest\\'s AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev\\'s matrix): 14.0004 14.0005 14.0006 16.0004 16.0005 16.0006 unassign domain 4 unbind queue 16.0005 assign domain 4 When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the APQNs that will be examined will be: 14.0004 16.0004 Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev\\'s matrix when updating the guest\\'s AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005 will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their pass-through. To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will be inspected when filtering the mdev\\'s matrix. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2024-26620](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-26620)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/850fb7fa8c684a4c6bf0e4b6978f4ddcc5d43d11)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c69d821197611678533fb3eb784fc823b921349a)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdd134d56138302976685e6c7bc4755450b3880e)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6b8d034b576f406af920a7bee81606c027b24c6) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfsd: fix RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER The test on so\\\\_count in nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() is nonsense and harmful. Revert to using check\\\\_for\\\\_locks(), changing that to not sleep. First: harmful. As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner(), the test on so\\\\_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a return of NFS4ERR\\\\_LOCKS\\\\_HELD when in fact no locks are held. This is clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause incorrect behaviour. If RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to the lock owner that causes nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() to return an incorrect error. The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR\\\\_LOCKS\\\\_HELD error because it never sends NFS4\\\\_RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so it knows that the error is impossible. It assumes the lock owner was in fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in some later locking request. When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE failed, it will naturally use a lock\\\\_seqid of zero. However the server, which didn\\'t release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock\\\\_seqid and so will respond with NFS4ERR\\\\_BAD\\\\_SEQID. So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing so\\\\_count allows. The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn\\'t mean anything. so\\\\_count is the sum of three different counts. 1/ the set of states listed on so\\\\_stateids 2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states 3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks. When it is tested against \\'2\\' it is clear that one of these is the transient reference obtained by find\\\\_lockowner\\\\_str\\\\_locked(). It is not clear what the other one is expected to be. In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state on so\\\\_stateids. If there were more, this would fail. In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER is called. In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER. That results in all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded (it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens when the lock state is discarded). When nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() finds that the lock owner doesn\\'t exist, it returns success. The other case shows an so\\\\_count of \\'2\\' and precisely one state listed in so\\\\_stateid. It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this test on \\'2\\' is safe. For another client it might not be safe. So this patch changes check\\\\_for\\\\_locks() to use the (newish) find\\\\_any\\\\_file\\\\_locked() so that it doesn\\'t take a reference on the nfs4\\\\_file and so never calls nfsd\\\\_file\\\\_put(), and so never sleeps. With this check is it safe to restore the use of check\\\\_for\\\\_locks() rather than testing so\\\\_count against the mysterious \\'2\\'. | 2024-03-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2024-26629](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-26629)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f5b860de87039b007e84a28a5eefc888154e098)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7d2eee1f53899b53f069bba3a59a419fc3d331b)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4cf8941664cae2f89f0189c29fe2ce8c6be0d03)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/edcf9725150e42beeca42d085149f4c88fa97afd) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache\\'s xarray to compute its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0. The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy\\'s logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer\\'s default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to \"Cluster\" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren\\'t known to be exposed. 2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3. 3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2. 3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it\\'s imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses. | 2024-03-12 | [8.2](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2022-34321&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2022-34321](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2022-34321)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://lists.apache.org/thread/ods5tq2hpl390hvjnvxv0bcg4rfpgjj8)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2022-34321/) |\\n| apache\\\\_software\\\\_foundation -- apache\\\\_pulsar | Improper input validation in the Pulsar Function Worker allows a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary Java code on the Pulsar Function worker, outside of the sandboxes designated for running user-provided functions.

These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren\\'t properly validated, contain special elements like \"..\", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\".

The supported URL schemes include \"file\", \"http\", and \"https\". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with \"functionsWorkerEnabled=true\". This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3. 3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3. 3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: \"additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns\" and \"additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns\". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation. | 2024-03-12 | [8.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-27894&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-27894](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-27894)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://lists.apache.org/thread/45cqhgqg8d19ongjw18ypcss8vwh206p)<br>  <br>[security@apache.org(link is external)](https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27894/) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in the edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.EdgeLoginServiceImpl.doLogin() function within wizardLogin. | 2024-03-13 | [9.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0799&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0799](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0799)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | A path traversal vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in edge-app-base-webui.jar!com.ca.arcserve.edge.app.base.ui.server.servlet.ImportNodeServlet. | 2024-03-13 | [8.8](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0800&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0800](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0800)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| arcserve -- unified\\\\_data\\\\_protection | A denial of service vulnerability exists in Arcserve Unified Data Protection 9.2 and 8.1 in ASNative.dll. | 2024-03-13 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-0801&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-0801](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-0801)<br>  <br>[vulnreport@tenable.com(link is external)](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2024-07) |\\n| argoproj -- argo-cd | Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links specified in the \\\\`link.argocd.argoproj.io\\\\` annotations in the application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI. When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the victim\\'s permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative, if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD. | 2024-03-13 | [9](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28175&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28175](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28175)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/479b5544b57dc9ef767d49f7003f39602c480b71)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwv5-8mqv-g387) |\\n| autopolisbg -- bulgarisation\\\\_for\\\\_woocommerce | The Bulgarisation for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing capability checks on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.14.

If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake. Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client doesn\\'t send any requests for the period of time configured in the binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part of the session being aborted.

A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application. This issue arises from the application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the \\\\`/conversation/ajax-html/send\\\\_log?folder\\\\_id=&thread\\\\_id={id}\\\\` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the \\\\`Swift\\\\_Transport\\\\_Esmtp\\\\_Auth\\\\_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()\\\\` function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should adopt the following measures: 1. Avoid Storing Complete Stack Traces, 2. Implement redaction mechanisms to filter and exclude sensitive information, and 3. Review and enhance the application\\'s logging practices. | 2024-03-12 | [7.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28186&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28186](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28186)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/commit/33639a89554998dcac645613130a27ac7872605e)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7wcq-2qmv-mvcm) |\\n| givewp -- give | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (\\'Cross-site Scripting\\') vulnerability in GiveWP Give allows Reflected XSS.This issue affects Give: from n/a through 3.3.1. | 2024-03-15 | [7.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-27987&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-27987](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-27987)<br>  <br>[audit@patchstack.com(link is external)](https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/give/wordpress-give-plugin-3-3-1-reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability?_s_id=cve) |\\n| go-vela -- worker | Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like \\\\`parameters\\\\`, \\\\`image\\\\` and \\\\`entrypoint\\\\` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and - by using common substitution string manipulation - can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the \"no commands\" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. \\\\*\\\\*To exploit this\\\\*\\\\* the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the \"no commands\" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in \\\\`parameters\\\\` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with \\\\`pull\\\\_request\\\\` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature. | 2024-03-12 | [7.7](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28236&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28236](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28236)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/e1572743b008e4fbce31ebb1dcd23bf6a1a30297)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/security/advisories/GHSA-pwx5-6wxg-px5h) |\\n| hammadh -- play.ht\\\\_-\\\\_make\\\\_your\\\\_blog\\\\_posts\\\\_accessible\\\\_with\\\\_text\\\\_to\\\\_speech\\\\_audio | The Play.ht - Make Your Blog Posts Accessible With Text to Speech Audio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 via deserialization of untrusted input from the play\\\\_podcast\\\\_data post meta.

TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren\\'t as robust as they should be.

This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information and to upload files into directories other than the intended directory for file uploads.

It\\'s possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root. The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang \\\\`#!/bin/zsh\\\\` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for the users password to be executed as root. However, it\\'ll still be using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file \\\\`$HOME/.zshenv\\\\` when the \\\\`postinstall\\\\` script is executed.

Zitadel uses a cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions. Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim\\'s account in certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The attack would further only be possible if there was an initial vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g. within your WAF): \\\\`\\\\_\\\\_Secure-zitadel-useragent\\\\`. | 2024-03-11 | [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28197&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28197](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28197)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr) |\\n| zoom\\\\_video\\\\_communications,\\\\_inc. -- zoom\\\\_rooms\\\\_client\\\\_for\\\\_windows | Improper access control in the installer for Zoom Rooms Client for Windows before version 5.17.5 may allow an authenticated user to conduct a denial of service via local access. | 2024-03-13 | [7.2](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-24693&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-24693](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-24693)<br>  <br>[security@zoom.us(link is external)](https://www.zoom.com/en/trust/security-bulletin/zsb-24009/) |\\n\\nShowing 1 to 195 of 195 entries\\n\\n[Back to top](#top)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMedium Vulnerabilities\\n----------------------\\n\\nSearch:\\n\\n| Primary  <br>Vendor -- Product | Description | Published | CVSS Score | Source & Patch Info |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| aio-libs -- aiosmtpd | aiosmtpd is a reimplementation of the Python stdlib smtpd.py based on asyncio. aiosmtpd is vulnerable to inbound SMTP smuggling.

This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device. Notes: Only the dhcpd process crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload. This vulnerability only applies to DHCPv4.

Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like \\\\`max\\\\_image\\\\_size\\\\_kb\\\\`, \\\\`max\\\\_attachment\\\\_size\\\\_kb\\\\` and \\\\`max\\\\_image\\\\_megapixels\\\\` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce \\\\`max\\\\_image\\\\_size\\\\_kb\\\\`, \\\\`max\\\\_attachment\\\\_size\\\\_kb\\\\` and \\\\`max\\\\_image\\\\_megapixels\\\\` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, \\\\`client\\\\_max\\\\_body\\\\_size\\\\` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server. | 2024-03-15 | [5.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-24827&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-24827](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-24827)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/003b80e62f97cd8c0114d6b9d3f93c10443e6fae)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-58vw-246g-fjj4) |\\n| discourse -- discourse | Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion.

Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some \\\\`\\\\_\\\\_destruct()\\\\` methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in \\\\`$this->\\\\_keys\\\\` to make PHP access to another array/object properties than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->\\\\_keys ...) for any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | 2024-03-15 | [5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2024-28859&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L \"CVSS V3 Score\") | [CVE-2024-28859](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-28859)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/commit/edb850f94fb4de18ca53d0d1824910d6e8130166)<br>  <br>[security-advisories@github.com(link is external)](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/security/advisories/GHSA-wjv8-pxr6-5f4r) |\\n| gacjie -- server | A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Gacjie Server up to 1.0.

Postal versions less than 3.0.0 are vulnerable to SMTP Smuggling attacks which may allow incoming e-mails to be spoofed. This, in conjunction with a cooperative outgoing SMTP service, would allow for an incoming e-mail to be received by Postal addressed from a server that a user has \\'authorised\\' to send mail on their behalf but were not the genuine author of the e-mail. Postal is not affected for sending outgoing e-mails as email is re-encoded with \\\\`<CR><LF>\\\\` line endings when transmitted over SMTP. This issue has been addressed and users should upgrade to Postal v3.0.0 or higher. Once upgraded, Postal will only accept End of DATA sequences which are explicitly \\\\`<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>\\\\`. If a non-compliant sequence is detected it will be logged to the SMTP server log.

A malicious insider without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector. User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest version as soon as possible.

YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their YourSpotify instance without their knowledge.

Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active\\\\_connection\\\\_id\\\\_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID includes a value in the retire\\\\_prior\\\\_to field, which elicits a RETIRE\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer\\'s congestion window size) so that RETIRE\\\\_CONNECTION\\\\_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue.

It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn\\'t do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It\\'s important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.

If blocksizes differ, sb\\\\_set\\\\_blocksize() will kill current buffers and page cache by using kill\\\\_bdev().

This can easily be reproduced by calling an infinite loop of: systemctl start <ext4\\\\_on\\\\_lvm>.mount, and systemctl stop <ext4\\\\_on\\\\_lvm>.mount ... since systemd creates a cgroup for each slice which it mounts, and the bh leak get amplified by a dying memory cgroup that also never gets freed, and memory consumption is much more easily noticed. | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47119](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47119)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01d349a481f0591230300a9171330136f9159bcd)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1385b23396d511d5233b8b921ac3058b3f86a5e1)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/afd09b617db3786b6ef3dc43e28fe728cfea84df) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect Commit 9d7b18668956 (\"HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic Trackpad 2\") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned success instead of -ENODEV when the check failed.

This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it can bring down the whole system via audit: 1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() can OOM kill a machine, see below details \\\\[0\\\\]. 2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc\\\\_has\\\\_perm()/slow\\\\_avc\\\\_audit() when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace\\\\_sched\\\\_switch() tracepoint, see details in \\\\[1\\\\]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like: rq\\\\_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+ trace\\\\_sched\\\\_switch() -> \\\\| bpf\\\\_prog\\\\_xyz() -> +-> deadlock selinux\\\\_lockdown() -> \\\\| audit\\\\_log\\\\_end() -> \\\\| wake\\\\_up\\\\_interruptible() -> \\\\| try\\\\_to\\\\_wake\\\\_up() -> \\\\| rq\\\\_lock(rq) --------------+ What\\'s worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check looks something like this: allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> }; However, this doesn\\'t match with the \\'current\\' task where the security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a bpf\\\\_probe\\\\_read\\\\_kernel{,\\\\_str}() helper call. The selinux\\\\_lockdown() hook does the permission check against \\'current\\', that is, httpd in this example. httpd has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall counts by user space application: bpftrace -e \\'tracepoint:raw\\\\_syscalls:sys\\\\_enter { @\\\\[comm\\\\] = count(); }\\' bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way of doing it \\\\[for the sake of the example\\\\] could be to call bpf\\\\_get\\\\_current\\\\_task() helper and then access current->comm via one of bpf\\\\_probe\\\\_read\\\\_kernel{,\\\\_str}() helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random app doing a syscall here. The BPF program \\\\_explicitly initiated\\\\_ the lockdown check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the system like my\\\\_random\\\\_tracer \\\\_not\\\\_. Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different approach for the security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() hook, that is, move the check into the program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since we\\'re moving this out of the BPF helper\\'s fast-path which can be called several millions of times per second. The check is then also in line with other security\\\\_locked\\\\_down() hooks in the system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example, open\\\\_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module\\\\_sig\\\\_check() for module signatures just to pick f ---truncated--- | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47128](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47128)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/acc43fc6cf0d50612193813c5906a1ab9d433e1e)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff40e51043af63715ab413995ff46996ecf9583f)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff5039ec75c83d2ed5b781dc7733420ee8c985fc) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: nft\\\\_ct: skip expectations for confirmed conntrack nft\\\\_ct\\\\_expect\\\\_obj\\\\_eval() calls nf\\\\_ct\\\\_ext\\\\_add() for a confirmed conntrack entry.

However, the socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active, and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context. This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode. On the TX side tls\\\\_sw\\\\_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving non-decrypted packets. The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown: first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released (it used to be possible to have a tls\\\\_dev\\\\_resync after tls\\\\_dev\\\\_del). A new flag called TLS\\\\_RX\\\\_DEV\\\\_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback mode. It\\'s used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync\\\\_async, which is allocated and freed by the driver). | 2024-03-15 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-47131](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-47131)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0f1e6fe66977a864fe850522316f713d7b926fd9)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c55dcdd435aa6c6ad6ccac0a4c636d010ee367a4)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1d4184f128dede82a59a841658ed40d4e6d3aa2) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp: fix sk\\\\_forward\\\\_memory corruption on retransmission MPTCP sk\\\\_forward\\\\_memory handling is a bit special, as such field is protected by the msk socket spin\\\\_lock, instead of the plain socket lock.

The crash logs can be seen at \\\\[1\\\\]. compact\\\\_zone() memunmap\\\\_pages ------------- --------------- \\\\_\\\\_pageblock\\\\_pfn\\\\_to\\\\_page ......

The commit b943f045a9af(\"mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with pfn\\\\_section\\\\_valid check\") tried to address the same problem by clearing the SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP with the expectation of valid\\\\_section() returns false thus ms->usage is not accessed. Fix this issue by the below steps: a) Clear SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP before freeing the ->usage. b) RCU protected read side critical section will either return NULL when SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage. c) Free the ->usage with kfree\\\\_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL. No attempt will be made to access ->usage after this as the SECTION\\\\_HAS\\\\_MEM\\\\_MAP is cleared thus valid\\\\_section() return false.

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration. The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the target page\\'s ->mapping field to save \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer between page unmap and page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1. Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug, attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus proceeding to dump the page. However, page\\\\_mapping() of the target page may return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump\\\\_mapping(), since the target page->mapping only saves \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer without setting PAGE\\\\_MAPPING\\\\_ANON flag. There are seveval ways to fix this issue: (1) Setting the PAGE\\\\_MAPPING\\\\_ANON flag for target page\\'s ->mapping when saving \\'anon\\\\_vma\\', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target page has not built mappings yet. (2) Getting the page lock to call page\\\\_mapping() in \\\\_\\\\_dump\\\\_page() to avoid crashing the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page\\\\_mapping() without holding the page lock, such as compaction. (3) Using target page->private field to save the \\'anon\\\\_vma\\' pointer and 2 bits page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove the page\\\\_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way. So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52490](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52490)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3889a418b6eb9a1113fb989aaadecf2f64964767)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9128bfbc5c80d8f4874dd0a0424d1f5fb010df1b)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1adb25df7111de83b64655a80b5a135adbded61) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_dec\\\\_device\\\\_run In mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_probe, &jpeg->job\\\\_timeout\\\\_work is bound with mtk\\\\_jpeg\\\\_job\\\\_timeout\\\\_work.

Address this by changing the code in question to use async\\\\_schedule\\\\_dev\\\\_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async\\\\_schedule\\\\_dev\\\\_nocall() returns false. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52498](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52498)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7839d0078e0d5e6cc2fa0b0dfbee71de74f1e557)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bd3dce27b01c51295b60e1433e1dadfb16649f7)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a1d62c775b07213c73f81ae842424c74dd14b5f0)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1c9d32c98309ae764893a481552d3f99d46cb34)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e681e29d1f59a04ef773296e4bebb17b1b79f8fe)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f46eb832389f162ad13cb780d0b8cde93641990d) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: firmware: arm\\\\_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency On reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message sequence number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the related payload is fetched too. When an SCMI command times out the channel ownership remains with the platform until eventually a late reply is received and, as a consequence, any further transmission attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel to be relinquished by the platform. Once that late reply is received the channel ownership is given back to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to proceed and overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply; then the wait for the reply to the new request starts. It has been observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can be wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that happens the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the fact that the message header now present in the SMT area is related to the new pending transaction, even though the real reply has still to arrive. This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by looking at the channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform will have set the channel free bit before triggering the completion IRQ. Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P ISR. | 2024-03-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2023-52608](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2023-52608)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12dc4217f16551d6dee9cbefc23fdb5659558cda)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/437a310b22244d4e0b78665c3042e5d1c0f45306)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/614cc65032dcb0b64d23f5c5e338a8a04b12be5d)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f95f6997f4fdd17abec3200cae45420a5489350)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b5e1b93c83ee5fc9f5d7bd2d45b421bd87774a2) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ksmbd: fix global oob in ksmbd\\\\_nl\\\\_policy Similar to a reported issue (check the commit b33fb5b801c6 (\"net: qualcomm: rmnet: fix global oob in rmnet\\\\_policy\"), my local fuzzer finds another global out-of-bounds read for policy ksmbd\\\\_nl\\\\_policy.

The purpose of the function is to update the guest\\'s AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only the APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain are inspected. If an APQN does not reference a queue device bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver, then it\\'s APID will be filtered from the mdev\\'s matrix when updating the guest\\'s AP configuration. Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new domain will result in passing AP queues through to a guest that are not bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver under certain circumstances. Consider the following: guest\\'s AP configuration (all also assigned to the mdev\\'s matrix): 14.0004 14.0005 14.0006 16.0004 16.0005 16.0006 unassign domain 4 unbind queue 16.0005 assign domain 4 When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected, the APQNs that will be examined will be: 14.0004 16.0004 Since both of those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the vfio\\\\_ap device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev\\'s matrix when updating the guest\\'s AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005 will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their pass-through. To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain assigned to the mdev will be inspected when filtering the mdev\\'s matrix. | 2024-03-11 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2024-26620](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-26620)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/850fb7fa8c684a4c6bf0e4b6978f4ddcc5d43d11)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c69d821197611678533fb3eb784fc823b921349a)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdd134d56138302976685e6c7bc4755450b3880e)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6b8d034b576f406af920a7bee81606c027b24c6) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfsd: fix RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER The test on so\\\\_count in nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() is nonsense and harmful. Revert to using check\\\\_for\\\\_locks(), changing that to not sleep. First: harmful. As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner(), the test on so\\\\_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a return of NFS4ERR\\\\_LOCKS\\\\_HELD when in fact no locks are held. This is clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause incorrect behaviour. If RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to the lock owner that causes nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() to return an incorrect error. The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR\\\\_LOCKS\\\\_HELD error because it never sends NFS4\\\\_RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so it knows that the error is impossible. It assumes the lock owner was in fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in some later locking request. When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE failed, it will naturally use a lock\\\\_seqid of zero. However the server, which didn\\'t release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock\\\\_seqid and so will respond with NFS4ERR\\\\_BAD\\\\_SEQID. So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing so\\\\_count allows. The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn\\'t mean anything. so\\\\_count is the sum of three different counts. 1/ the set of states listed on so\\\\_stateids 2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states 3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks. When it is tested against \\'2\\' it is clear that one of these is the transient reference obtained by find\\\\_lockowner\\\\_str\\\\_locked(). It is not clear what the other one is expected to be. In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state on so\\\\_stateids. If there were more, this would fail. In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER is called. In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE\\\\_LOCKOWNER. That results in all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded (it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens when the lock state is discarded). When nfsd4\\\\_release\\\\_lockowner() finds that the lock owner doesn\\'t exist, it returns success. The other case shows an so\\\\_count of \\'2\\' and precisely one state listed in so\\\\_stateid. It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this test on \\'2\\' is safe. For another client it might not be safe. So this patch changes check\\\\_for\\\\_locks() to use the (newish) find\\\\_any\\\\_file\\\\_locked() so that it doesn\\'t take a reference on the nfs4\\\\_file and so never calls nfsd\\\\_file\\\\_put(), and so never sleeps. With this check is it safe to restore the use of check\\\\_for\\\\_locks() rather than testing so\\\\_count against the mysterious \\'2\\'. | 2024-03-13 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2024-26629](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2024-26629)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f5b860de87039b007e84a28a5eefc888154e098)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7d2eee1f53899b53f069bba3a59a419fc3d331b)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4cf8941664cae2f89f0189c29fe2ce8c6be0d03)<br>  <br>[416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67(link is external)](https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/edcf9725150e42beeca42d085149f4c88fa97afd) |\\\\\\n| linux -- linux | In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk In cachestat, we access the folio from the page cache\\'s xarray to compute its page offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags.

The newly identified CVE-2024-4577 vulnerability, affecting Windows-based PHP servers, could allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) if successfully exploited. This CGI argument injection flaw impacts all versions of PHP on Windows OS and affects all default XAMPP installations. In the blog, we will discuss more about this vulnerability in detail.\\xa0\\n\\nCVE-2024-4577 Vulnerability\\n---------------------------\\n\\nA new critical security flaw impacting PHP, identified as **CVE-2024-4577**, has emerged and could be exploited to achieve remote code execution. This CGI argument injection vulnerability affected all PHP versions on the Windows operating system. DEVCORE security researchers revealed that the flaw bypasses protections from a previous vulnerability, **CVE-2012-1823**, by exploiting the best-fit feature of Windows encoding conversion. As a result, arbitrary code execution is possible on remote PHP servers.\\xa0  \\nThe updates were released in PHP versions 8.3.8, 8.2.20, and 8.1.29. DEVCORE warns that XAMPP installations on Windows are particularly vulnerable when using Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, or Japanese locales. Administrators should switch to more secure options such as Mod-PHP, FastCGI, or PHP-FPM. The Shadowserver Foundation detected exploitation attempts within 24 hours of disclosure, while Watchtower Labs successfully devised an exploit, emphasizing the urgency for users to apply the latest patches.\\n\\nImpact of the Vulnerability\\n---------------------------\\n\\nCVE-2024-4577 poses substantial risks due to its low complexity for exploitation and the publicly accessible PoC exploit code on GitHub, increasing the likelihood of real-world attacks. This situation demands a rapid response from defenders and heightened cybersecurity awareness.

The newly identified CVE-2024-4577 vulnerability, affecting Windows-based PHP servers, could allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) if successfully exploited. This CGI argument injection flaw impacts all versions of PHP on Windows OS and affects all default XAMPP installations. In the blog, we will discuss more about this vulnerability in detail.\\xa0\\n\\nCVE-2024-4577 Vulnerability\\n---------------------------\\n\\nA new critical security flaw impacting PHP, identified as **CVE-2024-4577**, has emerged and could be exploited to achieve remote code execution. This CGI argument injection vulnerability affected all PHP versions on the Windows operating system. DEVCORE security researchers revealed that the flaw bypasses protections from a previous vulnerability, **CVE-2012-1823**, by exploiting the best-fit feature of Windows encoding conversion. As a result, arbitrary code execution is possible on remote PHP servers.\\xa0  \\nThe updates were released in PHP versions 8.3.8, 8.2.20, and 8.1.29. DEVCORE warns that XAMPP installations on Windows are particularly vulnerable when using Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, or Japanese locales. Administrators should switch to more secure options such as Mod-PHP, FastCGI, or PHP-FPM. The Shadowserver Foundation detected exploitation attempts within 24 hours of disclosure, while Watchtower Labs successfully devised an exploit, emphasizing the urgency for users to apply the latest patches.\\n\\nImpact of the Vulnerability\\n---------------------------\\n\\nCVE-2024-4577 poses substantial risks due to its low complexity for exploitation and the publicly accessible PoC exploit code on GitHub, increasing the likelihood of real-world attacks. This situation demands a rapid response from defenders and heightened cybersecurity awareness. To address these challenges, rely on SOC Prime’s comprehensive product suite for AI-powered Detection Engineering, Automated Threat Hunting, and Detection Stack Validation. This suite enables timely identification and resolution of cyber defense blind spots, proactive hunting for emerging threats, and prioritization of detection efforts, ensuring you stay ahead of attackers.\\n\\nHow Can You Determine if you’re Vulnerable to the attack?\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFor the common Apache HTTP Server and PHP combination, website administrators can use the two methods described in this article to check if their server is vulnerable to attacks. Scenario 2 is the default configuration for XAMPP installations on Windows, making all versions of XAMPP for Windows inherently vulnerable to this issue.\\n\\nUnauthorized attackers can execute arbitrary code directly on the remote server when the Windows operating system is configured with the following languages:\\n\\n[![LiquidBase](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3-Liquibase-Security-Partners-Solution-section-770X330-1-1.png)](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/liquibase-trial/?utm_source=devops.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n[![Rafay Demo](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Rafay.png)](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n\\n[](https://devops.com/rafay-demo/)\\n[![Clarity](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OnDemand-2024.07.18-Claroty-LandingPage-1540x660-2.png)](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n[](https://webinars.techstronglearning.com/addressing-the-security-challenges-of-industrial-ot-and-iot?utm_source=Securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n[![Techstrong Podcasts](https://cloudnativenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1-4.png)](https://techstrongpodcasts.com/?ref=in-article-ad-2&utm_source=do&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=digital-banners-1&utm_id=digital-banners-1)\\n\\n[![AWS](https://cloudnativenow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Banner_2.png-770.png)](https://devops.com/builder-community-hub/?utm_source=securityboulevard.com&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=in-article-ad)\\n\\n*   Traditional Chinese (character page 950)\\n*   Simplified Chinese (code page 936)\\n*   Japanese (code page 932)\\n\\nFor Windows operating systems running in English, Korean, and Western European languages, the extensive range of PHP usage scenarios makes it difficult to fully list and exclude all potential vulnerabilities.\\n\\n### Book a Free Consultation with our Cyber Security Experts\\n\\n![](https://awareness.threatcop.ai/marketing/cybergeek.webp)\\n\\n###### Name\\n\\n###### Email\\n\\n###### Company Name\\n\\n###### Phone Number\\n\\n  \\n\\nConditions of a Server Vulnerable to Attack\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nBelow are a few conditions of a server vulnerable to attack:\\xa0\\n\\n*   The issue specifically affects web servers running on Windows due to how the operating system converts specific string characters based on the locale settings.

This blog will cover how we discovered [CVE-2024-21378](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21378)\\n and weaponized it by modifying [Ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler)\\n, an Outlook penetration testing tool published by SensePost. Note, a pull request containing the proof-of-concept code is forthcoming to provide organizations with sufficient time to patch.\\n\\nEdit: The pull request containing the PoC can be found at [https://github.com/sensepost/ruler/pull/144](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler/pull/144)\\n\\nAn Overview of the Vulnerability\\xa0\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nThe original variant of this [attack](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/)\\n was documented by [Etienne Stalmans](https://twitter.com/_staaldraad)\\n at SensePost (Orange CyberDefense) in 2017 and leveraged VBScript code inside Outlook form objects to obtain code execution with access to a mailbox. In response, a [patch](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/custom-form-script-is-now-disabled-by-default-bd8ea308-733f-4728-bfcc-d7cce0120e94)\\n was issued to enforce allowlisting for script code in custom forms. However, the syncing capability of these form objects was never altered.\\xa0\\n\\nUnderneath, [forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/outlook-mapi-reference)\\n are [MAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/mapi-programming-overview)\\n synced using _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_ objects. These objects carry special properties and attachments which are used to “install” the form when it’s first used on a client. Below is an overview of this procedure:\\xa0\\n\\n1.  Outlook requests the instantiation of a particular message class (_IPM.Note.Evil_).\\xa0\\n2.  The MAPI associated contents table of the relevant folder is consulted for _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_ objects.\\xa0\\n3.  If the classname stored in the [_PidTagOfflineAddressBookName_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/exchange_server_protocols/ms-oxoab/b4750386-66ec-4e69-abb6-208dd131c7de)\\n     property matches, the form installation process starts.\\xa0\\n4.  The _PidTagOfflineAddressBookDistinguishedName_ is used as the CLSID for the new form install (all forms are COM objects).\\xa0\\n5.  The first attachment of the form description and a special property, _0x6902001F_, determines what registry keys need to be added under the CLSID to install the form.\\xa0\\n\\n*   In older style forms (“Forms that bypass outlook”), these registry values typically include InProcServer keys or equivalents that bond to DLLs extracted to disk.\\xa0\\n*   In newer forms, Outlook-specific _MsgClass_ keys are used to bond the form to an OLE object extracted to disk.\\xa0\\n*   Inside any of these keys, _%d_ can be used to refer to the directory where the remaining form attachments are extracted (_%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMS)._\\xa0\\n\\n6.  After the registry changes are confirmed, Outlook proceeds to load the form as a COM object.\\xa0\\n\\nThere were some serious issues with this process:\\xa0\\n\\n*   When extracting the attachments to _%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMS_, you can perform path traversal via the _PidTagAttachFilename_ property. You can also have multiple files written to disk. This essentially is an arbitrary disk write primitive anytime the form is installed.\\xa0\\n*   When creating registry keys for the form, the _0x6902001F_ property data is broken by newline expecting _key=value_ lines. Each line is processed where _key_ is a subkey of the CLSID root, and _value_ is the default value for that key. To prevent “Forms that bypass outlook”, a denylist of typical COM server keys (_InProcServer_, _LocalServer_, etc.) is compared against the start of each line (OLMAPI32.DLL). However, when installing the value, you can use a leading character to imply a full subkey path under HKCR. For instance, _CLSID<CLSID>InprocServer32=%devil.dll_ will bypass the denylist check and result in a full COM object registration for the form.\\xa0\\n\\nWe found that we had the ability to create arbitrary files on disk, as well as install arbitrary registry keys (with default values) under HKEY\\\\_CLASSES\\\\_ROOT (HKCR). These primitives are enough to gain trivial RCE.\\n\\nIn-Depth Review\\n---------------\\n\\n### Setting the Stage\\n\\nColloquially, we consider this to be the fourth iteration of a series of attacks based on the premise of using compromised credentials to sync objects through Exchange. In late 2015, Nick Landers, Co-Founder of Dreadnode, published a [blog](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/adversary-simulation/malicious-outlook-rules/)\\n on the abuse of Outlook Rules for RCE. Over the next couple of years Etienne (SensePost) and Nick dual discovered two additional sets of vectors which were eventually patched by Microsoft, including the abuse of Outlook Forms. SensePost released an excellent set of blogs (see references) digging into the vulnerabilities and underlying technologies as well as the exploitation tool, [Ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler)\\n.\\xa0\\n\\nWe intended to come back to this research as we felt that Outlook features a vast, underexplored attack surface and our repeated success on engagements over the last couple of years with [Device Code phishing/vishing](https://aadinternals.com/post/phishing/)\\n was the final push we needed.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe began our research by manually exploring [Outlook forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/outlook/Concepts/Outlook-Forms/create-an-outlook-form)\\n from the Outlook Client, as well as, with [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/microsoft/mfcmapi)\\n and ProcMon. We will keep an overview of the underlying technology high-level, but essentially the various items available through Outlook (messages, calendar invites, tasks, etc.) are displayed through a form structure in an “inspector window”. Outlook both contains standard forms and allows custom forms that can be published and synced through Exchange (including Exchange Online).\\xa0\\n\\nDuring our research we came upon the [format of form configuration files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/file-format-of-form-configuration-files)\\n which can be used to install a custom form.

We confirmed execution of an arbitrary DLL, but we still have a bit to go towards anything useful. On the backend, upon installing the form the configuration file was converted to an\\xa0_IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_\\xa0Message Class object and stored within the Inbox directory in Outlook. A review of the associated registry key after choosing the custom form from the developer tab revealed that our DLL was stored in\\xa0_%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMSIPM.Note.Hello,_\\xa0confirming not only execution but also seemingly arbitrary registry writes, and file write to disk.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture8-1.png)\\n\\n### Homing In\\n\\nTo gain a better understanding of what was happening underneath the hood we started exploring the contents of Outlook with MFCMAPI. Outlook contains your email but it’s also a database, and we can think of MFCMAPI as essentially a database exploration tool that provides you with access to\\xa0properties and objects\\xa0that are not otherwise visible in the Outlook client. From within MFCMAPI we right clicked on our Inbox (since that is where we saved our custom form) and navigated to the “Open associated contents table” button where we found the new form and its various properties.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture9-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the hidden contents table for our Inbox Folder_\\n\\nAs we explored how to recreate the _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_  \\nobjects in code, we began asking ourselves, “what is the difference between a form that can be installed and a form that ‘bypasses Outlook’? What makes that determination?”\\xa0\\n\\nThe property that seemed the most immediately relevant was the “PidTagOfflineAddressBookDistinguishedName” or “PR\\\\_OAB\\\\_DN”. This property tag contained the COM GUID that we have assigned in the configuration file, which ultimately defines what COM CLSID the form was eventually registered as. This was interesting because it seemed that we could create any registry key under HKCR and set it’s (default) value. Additionally, if the CLSID is arbitrary then what is stopping us from putting in the CLSID of an existing object and performing a classic COM hijack? Again, SensePost provides an\\xa0[overview\\xa0of these property tags](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/)\\n\\xa0and their importance so we will refrain from re-stating the same here.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture10-1.jpg)\\n\\n_Property tags and their value for the IPM.Note.Hello form_\\n\\nWe then right clicked on the form, selected “Attachments -> Display attachments table” and found the form contained several attachments, including the DLL to be registered through the form message object. Within the first attachment we also found our registry key information within a couple of property tags. We noticed the PR\\\\_ATTACH\\\\_DATA\\\\_BIN property did not seem important as we could hollow out the contents and sync the form back to Outlook with no effect. We discovered that the value for the _0x6902001F_ property determined what registry keys need to be added under the CLSID to install the form – another seemingly critical component. Within the first attachment we also found our registry key information within a couple of property tags.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture11-1.png)\\n\\n_The form attachments table in MFCMAPI_\\n\\nWe then used Ruler to send ourselves a form intended to execute a VBScript and began comparing it to our COM DLL execution form. Reviewing the results, we confirm that the values passed in the\\xa0_0x6902001F_\\xa0property tag were used to set registry keys.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture12-1.png)\\n\\n_Testing various inputs in the 0x6092001F property tag_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture13-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the results in the registry_\\xa0\\n\\nWe also found that adding InProcServer32, to the VBScript form keys and syncing the form back to Outlook via MFCMAPI would cause a failure as we would receive the “Forms that bypass Outlook cannot be installed” error. We could clearly see this was a denylist as any other key we set would be created.\\n\\nThis brought us to a new line of questioning, the first being where is this denylist\\xa0implemented? Could we circumvent this denylist through alternative registry keys that would not be on the denylist but would still allow us to gain code execution or execute a COM hijack? Do they limit the GUID? If we supply a GUID of a CLSID that already exists, would that work, append to the registry, or fail out?\\xa0But then again, it seemed arbitrary, whatever keys we put in the form would simply be created, which seemed to us like just a bad policy.\\n\\nWe decided to start hunting for where the denylist was occurring. This is a bit tricky because Outlook is a beast to decompile, but we might be able to get there with help from ProcMon. We open ProcMon and execute the form one more time specifically filtering for our COM GUID.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture14-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the stack in Process Monitor_\\n\\nAs you can see above the last call in the stack before\\xa0_RegOpenKeyExA_\\xa0follows from a function call in OLMAPI32.DLL. We begin decompiling OLMAPI32.DLL and meander through functions and their references,\\xa0_ScOpenRegKey ->\\xa0RegisterFormClass\\xa0-> HrDownloadFormFiles_,\\xa0until we eventually come upon a familiar looking property tag,\\xa0_0x6902001F_! Well, we find\\xa0_0x6902001E_\\xa0which is the ASCII version of our original property tag.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture15-1.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture16-1.png)\\n\\n_Jumping to our address identified in ProcMon_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture17-2.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing references to ScOpenRegKey and discovering RegisterFormClass_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture18-1.png)\\n\\n_Selecting a reference to RegisterFormClass_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture19-1.png)\\n\\n_Discovering our property tag of interest within the RegisterFormClass function_\\n\\nReviewing\\xa0_RegisterFormClass_\\xa0once again we find our check function (_sub\\\\_1803DF094_) and the denylist variable (_v8 = (LPCSTR \\\\*)off\\\\_1806DAB0)._\\xa0\\n\\nNote: some of the variable and function names below have been modified for clarity.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture20-1.png)\\n\\n_The check function and denylist variable (names modified)_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture21-1.png)\\n\\n_Our sought after\\xa0denylist\\xa0variable_\\n\\nReviewing the delta between the denylist check and the installation we find a simple bypass using a relative path by prefacing each new line with “”.

Having identified a vulnerability we could exploit for remote code execution, we proceeded to fork and modify Ruler to support authentication to Exchange Online via compromised\\xa0[access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens)\\n. We considered various execution techniques but for the purpose of this proof-of-concept we kept it simple by adding code to sync a form containing the required properties to execute an arbitrary COM compliant native DLL.\\xa0The public fork containing the PoC code will be found\\xa0[here](https://github.com/NetSPI/ruler)\\n\\xa0along with a pull request to the original repo at a later date.\\n\\nSome initial OpSec concerns we identified off the bat:\\n\\n*   Triggering the form requires user interaction for execution (although some further digging might reveal automated execution).\\n*   The DLL will be extracted to the well-known FORMS directory, which could be monitored from historical attacks.\\n*   CLSID changes in the registry are executed by the Outlook process.\\n*   The DLL will be loaded into the Outlook process.\\n\\nBelow we provide a high-level overview for a general exploitation flow:\\n\\n1.  Obtain credential material for a targeted user.\\n2.  Create a COM compliant DLL that we want to execute.\\n3.  Specify our credential material, DLL and other required/optional parameters to Ruler.\\n4.  Ruler will authenticate to the Exchange Server/Exchange Online and send the form as an email.\\n5.  The user will then need to trigger the form by either clicking, forwarding, or printing the email from their Microsoft Outlook thick client on a Windows device.\\n6.  Execution of the form will create the registry keys, drop the DLL to disk and load the DLL into the Outlook process.\\n\\n### Walkthrough from Device Code to Execution\\n\\nIn this section, we will walk through practical exploitation of the issue.

This blog will cover how we discovered [CVE-2024-21378](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21378)\\n and weaponized it by modifying [Ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler)\\n, an Outlook penetration testing tool published by SensePost. Note, a pull request containing the proof-of-concept code is forthcoming to provide organizations with sufficient time to patch.\\n\\nEdit: The pull request containing the PoC can be found at [https://github.com/sensepost/ruler/pull/144](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler/pull/144)\\n\\nAn Overview of the Vulnerability\\xa0\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nThe original variant of this [attack](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/)\\n was documented by [Etienne Stalmans](https://twitter.com/_staaldraad)\\n at SensePost (Orange CyberDefense) in 2017 and leveraged VBScript code inside Outlook form objects to obtain code execution with access to a mailbox. In response, a [patch](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/custom-form-script-is-now-disabled-by-default-bd8ea308-733f-4728-bfcc-d7cce0120e94)\\n was issued to enforce allowlisting for script code in custom forms. However, the syncing capability of these form objects was never altered.\\xa0\\n\\nUnderneath, [forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/outlook-mapi-reference)\\n are [MAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/mapi-programming-overview)\\n synced using _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_ objects. These objects carry special properties and attachments which are used to “install” the form when it’s first used on a client. Below is an overview of this procedure:\\xa0\\n\\n1.  Outlook requests the instantiation of a particular message class (_IPM.Note.Evil_).\\xa0\\n2.  The MAPI associated contents table of the relevant folder is consulted for _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_ objects.\\xa0\\n3.  If the classname stored in the [_PidTagOfflineAddressBookName_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/exchange_server_protocols/ms-oxoab/b4750386-66ec-4e69-abb6-208dd131c7de)\\n     property matches, the form installation process starts.\\xa0\\n4.  The _PidTagOfflineAddressBookDistinguishedName_ is used as the CLSID for the new form install (all forms are COM objects).\\xa0\\n5.  The first attachment of the form description and a special property, _0x6902001F_, determines what registry keys need to be added under the CLSID to install the form.\\xa0\\n\\n*   In older style forms (“Forms that bypass outlook”), these registry values typically include InProcServer keys or equivalents that bond to DLLs extracted to disk.\\xa0\\n*   In newer forms, Outlook-specific _MsgClass_ keys are used to bond the form to an OLE object extracted to disk.\\xa0\\n*   Inside any of these keys, _%d_ can be used to refer to the directory where the remaining form attachments are extracted (_%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMS)._\\xa0\\n\\n6.  After the registry changes are confirmed, Outlook proceeds to load the form as a COM object.\\xa0\\n\\nThere were some serious issues with this process:\\xa0\\n\\n*   When extracting the attachments to _%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMS_, you can perform path traversal via the _PidTagAttachFilename_ property. You can also have multiple files written to disk. This essentially is an arbitrary disk write primitive anytime the form is installed.\\xa0\\n*   When creating registry keys for the form, the _0x6902001F_ property data is broken by newline expecting _key=value_ lines. Each line is processed where _key_ is a subkey of the CLSID root, and _value_ is the default value for that key. To prevent “Forms that bypass outlook”, a denylist of typical COM server keys (_InProcServer_, _LocalServer_, etc.) is compared against the start of each line (OLMAPI32.DLL). However, when installing the value, you can use a leading character to imply a full subkey path under HKCR. For instance, _CLSID<CLSID>InprocServer32=%devil.dll_ will bypass the denylist check and result in a full COM object registration for the form.\\xa0\\n\\nWe found that we had the ability to create arbitrary files on disk, as well as install arbitrary registry keys (with default values) under HKEY\\\\_CLASSES\\\\_ROOT (HKCR). These primitives are enough to gain trivial RCE.\\n\\nIn-Depth Review\\n---------------\\n\\n### Setting the Stage\\n\\nColloquially, we consider this to be the fourth iteration of a series of attacks based on the premise of using compromised credentials to sync objects through Exchange. In late 2015, Nick Landers, Co-Founder of Dreadnode, published a [blog](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/adversary-simulation/malicious-outlook-rules/)\\n on the abuse of Outlook Rules for RCE. Over the next couple of years Etienne (SensePost) and Nick dual discovered two additional sets of vectors which were eventually patched by Microsoft, including the abuse of Outlook Forms. SensePost released an excellent set of blogs (see references) digging into the vulnerabilities and underlying technologies as well as the exploitation tool, [Ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler)\\n.\\xa0\\n\\nWe intended to come back to this research as we felt that Outlook features a vast, underexplored attack surface and our repeated success on engagements over the last couple of years with [Device Code phishing/vishing](https://aadinternals.com/post/phishing/)\\n was the final push we needed.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nWe began our research by manually exploring [Outlook forms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/outlook/Concepts/Outlook-Forms/create-an-outlook-form)\\n from the Outlook Client, as well as, with [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/microsoft/mfcmapi)\\n and ProcMon. We will keep an overview of the underlying technology high-level, but essentially the various items available through Outlook (messages, calendar invites, tasks, etc.) are displayed through a form structure in an “inspector window”. Outlook both contains standard forms and allows custom forms that can be published and synced through Exchange (including Exchange Online).\\xa0\\n\\nDuring our research we came upon the [format of form configuration files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/file-format-of-form-configuration-files)\\n which can be used to install a custom form. Of particular interest were the [file and registry entries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/form-configuration-file-platforms-section)\\n.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/themes/netspi/assets/images/blockquote-left.svg)![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/themes/netspi/assets/images/blockquote-right.svg)\\n\\n> _The File entry lists the form server application executable file that the form library maintains and loads into a new subdirectory in the disk cache when the form is launched. . ._\\n> \\n> _The Registry entry is used whenever the File entry is used, it identifies the registry key for the form library where the executable file for the form server application is stored. . ._\\n\\nWe first attempted to prove out local code execution. Below is an example form config that we can import directly into Outlook to install a form. We set the _File_ entry to the location of a DLL we would like to install with our form and saved this file to c:pochello.cfg.\\xa0\\n\\nPlain text\\n\\nCopy to clipboard\\n\\nOpen code in new window\\n\\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\\n\\n\\\\[Description\\\\]\\n\\nMessageClass=IPM.Note.Hello\\n\\nCLSID={00000000-1234-1234-1234-000000000000}\\n\\nDisplayName=Hello\\n\\nCategory=Standard\\n\\nSubcategory=Form\\n\\nComment=Hello\\n\\nSmallIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico\\n\\nLargeIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico\\n\\n\\\\[Platforms\\\\]\\n\\nPlatform1=Win16\\n\\n\\\\[Platform.Win16\\\\]\\n\\nCPU=ix86\\n\\nOSVersion=Win3.1\\n\\nFile = C:pochello.dll\\n\\nRegistry = InprocServer32 = %dhello.dll\\n\\n\\\\[Description\\\\] MessageClass=IPM.Note.Hello CLSID={00000000-1234-1234-1234-000000000000} DisplayName=Hello Category=Standard Subcategory=Form Comment=Hello SmallIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico LargeIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico \\\\[Platforms\\\\] Platform1=Win16 \\\\[Platform.Win16\\\\] CPU=ix86 OSVersion=Win3.1 File = C:pochello.dll Registry = InprocServer32 = %dhello.dll\\n\\n\\\\[Description\\\\] \\nMessageClass=IPM.Note.Hello \\nCLSID={00000000-1234-1234-1234-000000000000} \\nDisplayName=Hello \\nCategory=Standard \\nSubcategory=Form \\nComment=Hello \\nSmallIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico \\nLargeIcon=C:WindowsSysWOW64OneDrive.ico \\n\\n\\\\[Platforms\\\\] \\nPlatform1=Win16 \\n\\n\\\\[Platform.Win16\\\\] \\nCPU=ix86 \\nOSVersion=Win3.1 \\nFile = C:pochello.dll \\nRegistry = InprocServer32 = %dhello.dll \\n\\nFor testing purposes, we compiled a DLL with an execution primitive inside DllMain and again, placed it within the same folder as our hello.cfg file above.\\n\\nPlain text\\n\\nCopy to clipboard\\n\\nOpen code in new window\\n\\nEnlighterJS 3 Syntax Highlighter\\n\\n#include <Windows.h>\\n\\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE module, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved) {\\n\\nif (reason == DLL\\\\_PROCESS\\\\_ATTACH) {\\n\\nMessageBoxA(0, \"Hello\", \"Ruh Roh\", 0);\\n\\n}\\n\\nreturn TRUE;\\n\\n}\\n\\n#include <Windows.h> BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE module, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved) { if (reason == DLL\\\\_PROCESS\\\\_ATTACH) { MessageBoxA(0, \"Hello\", \"Ruh Roh\", 0); } return TRUE; }\\n\\n#include <Windows.h> \\n\\nBOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE module, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved) { \\n\\n     if (reason == DLL\\\\_PROCESS\\\\_ATTACH) { \\n\\n     MessageBoxA(0, \"Hello\", \"Ruh Roh\", 0); \\n\\n     } \\n\\n     return TRUE;\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe configuration file can then be used to install a form within Outlook by navigating to File -> Options -> Advanced -> Custom Forms and selecting the hello.cfg file.\\n\\nNote: we set the location to Inbox when installing the custom form via config file.\\xa0\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture1-1.png)\\n\\n_Navigating to the Forms Manager_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE_Picture2-1.png)\\n\\n_Installing the custom form config file in the Inbox folder_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture3-1.png)\\n\\n_Verifying the form has been installed_\\n\\nWe then proceeded to select the Developer tab -> Choose Form and open our newly created form.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture4-1.png)\\n\\n_Attempting to open our newly installed form_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/PCVE-icture5-1.png)\\n\\nWell, not ideal but we remembered seeing a potentially related configuration when installing the form config file.

A review of the associated registry key after choosing the custom form from the developer tab revealed that our DLL was stored in\\xa0_%localappdata%MicrosoftFORMSIPM.Note.Hello,_\\xa0confirming not only execution but also seemingly arbitrary registry writes, and file write to disk.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture8-1.png)\\n\\n### Homing In\\n\\nTo gain a better understanding of what was happening underneath the hood we started exploring the contents of Outlook with MFCMAPI. Outlook contains your email but it’s also a database, and we can think of MFCMAPI as essentially a database exploration tool that provides you with access to\\xa0properties and objects\\xa0that are not otherwise visible in the Outlook client. From within MFCMAPI we right clicked on our Inbox (since that is where we saved our custom form) and navigated to the “Open associated contents table” button where we found the new form and its various properties.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture9-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the hidden contents table for our Inbox Folder_\\n\\nAs we explored how to recreate the _IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.FormsDescription_  \\nobjects in code, we began asking ourselves, “what is the difference between a form that can be installed and a form that ‘bypasses Outlook’? What makes that determination?”\\xa0\\n\\nThe property that seemed the most immediately relevant was the “PidTagOfflineAddressBookDistinguishedName” or “PR\\\\_OAB\\\\_DN”. This property tag contained the COM GUID that we have assigned in the configuration file, which ultimately defines what COM CLSID the form was eventually registered as. This was interesting because it seemed that we could create any registry key under HKCR and set it’s (default) value. Additionally, if the CLSID is arbitrary then what is stopping us from putting in the CLSID of an existing object and performing a classic COM hijack? Again, SensePost provides an\\xa0[overview\\xa0of these property tags](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/)\\n\\xa0and their importance so we will refrain from re-stating the same here.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture10-1.jpg)\\n\\n_Property tags and their value for the IPM.Note.Hello form_\\n\\nWe then right clicked on the form, selected “Attachments -> Display attachments table” and found the form contained several attachments, including the DLL to be registered through the form message object. Within the first attachment we also found our registry key information within a couple of property tags. We noticed the PR\\\\_ATTACH\\\\_DATA\\\\_BIN property did not seem important as we could hollow out the contents and sync the form back to Outlook with no effect. We discovered that the value for the _0x6902001F_ property determined what registry keys need to be added under the CLSID to install the form – another seemingly critical component. Within the first attachment we also found our registry key information within a couple of property tags.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture11-1.png)\\n\\n_The form attachments table in MFCMAPI_\\n\\nWe then used Ruler to send ourselves a form intended to execute a VBScript and began comparing it to our COM DLL execution form. Reviewing the results, we confirm that the values passed in the\\xa0_0x6902001F_\\xa0property tag were used to set registry keys.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture12-1.png)\\n\\n_Testing various inputs in the 0x6092001F property tag_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture13-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the results in the registry_\\xa0\\n\\nWe also found that adding InProcServer32, to the VBScript form keys and syncing the form back to Outlook via MFCMAPI would cause a failure as we would receive the “Forms that bypass Outlook cannot be installed” error. We could clearly see this was a denylist as any other key we set would be created.\\n\\nThis brought us to a new line of questioning, the first being where is this denylist\\xa0implemented? Could we circumvent this denylist through alternative registry keys that would not be on the denylist but would still allow us to gain code execution or execute a COM hijack? Do they limit the GUID? If we supply a GUID of a CLSID that already exists, would that work, append to the registry, or fail out?\\xa0But then again, it seemed arbitrary, whatever keys we put in the form would simply be created, which seemed to us like just a bad policy.\\n\\nWe decided to start hunting for where the denylist was occurring. This is a bit tricky because Outlook is a beast to decompile, but we might be able to get there with help from ProcMon. We open ProcMon and execute the form one more time specifically filtering for our COM GUID.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture14-1.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing the stack in Process Monitor_\\n\\nAs you can see above the last call in the stack before\\xa0_RegOpenKeyExA_\\xa0follows from a function call in OLMAPI32.DLL. We begin decompiling OLMAPI32.DLL and meander through functions and their references,\\xa0_ScOpenRegKey ->\\xa0RegisterFormClass\\xa0-> HrDownloadFormFiles_,\\xa0until we eventually come upon a familiar looking property tag,\\xa0_0x6902001F_! Well, we find\\xa0_0x6902001E_\\xa0which is the ASCII version of our original property tag.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture15-1.png)\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture16-1.png)\\n\\n_Jumping to our address identified in ProcMon_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture17-2.png)\\n\\n_Reviewing references to ScOpenRegKey and discovering RegisterFormClass_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture18-1.png)\\n\\n_Selecting a reference to RegisterFormClass_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture19-1.png)\\n\\n_Discovering our property tag of interest within the RegisterFormClass function_\\n\\nReviewing\\xa0_RegisterFormClass_\\xa0once again we find our check function (_sub\\\\_1803DF094_) and the denylist variable (_v8 = (LPCSTR \\\\*)off\\\\_1806DAB0)._\\xa0\\n\\nNote: some of the variable and function names below have been modified for clarity.\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture20-1.png)\\n\\n_The check function and denylist variable (names modified)_\\n\\n![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/CVE-Picture21-1.png)\\n\\n_Our sought after\\xa0denylist\\xa0variable_\\n\\nReviewing the delta between the denylist check and the installation we find a simple bypass using a relative path by prefacing each new line with “”.

Having identified a vulnerability we could exploit for remote code execution, we proceeded to fork and modify Ruler to support authentication to Exchange Online via compromised\\xa0[access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-tokens)\\n. We considered various execution techniques but for the purpose of this proof-of-concept we kept it simple by adding code to sync a form containing the required properties to execute an arbitrary COM compliant native DLL.\\xa0The public fork containing the PoC code will be found\\xa0[here](https://github.com/NetSPI/ruler)\\n\\xa0along with a pull request to the original repo at a later date.\\n\\nSome initial OpSec concerns we identified off the bat:\\n\\n*   Triggering the form requires user interaction for execution (although some further digging might reveal automated execution).\\n*   The DLL will be extracted to the well-known FORMS directory, which could be monitored from historical attacks.\\n*   CLSID changes in the registry are executed by the Outlook process.\\n*   The DLL will be loaded into the Outlook process.\\n\\nBelow we provide a high-level overview for a general exploitation flow:\\n\\n1.  Obtain credential material for a targeted user.\\n2.  Create a COM compliant DLL that we want to execute.\\n3.  Specify our credential material, DLL and other required/optional parameters to Ruler.\\n4.  Ruler will authenticate to the Exchange Server/Exchange Online and send the form as an email.\\n5.  The user will then need to trigger the form by either clicking, forwarding, or printing the email from their Microsoft Outlook thick client on a Windows device.\\n6.  Execution of the form will create the registry keys, drop the DLL to disk and load the DLL into the Outlook process.\\n\\n### Walkthrough from Device Code to Execution\\n\\nIn this section, we will walk through practical exploitation of the issue.

Discovering the vulnerability and bypassing it wasn’t overly complicated – we took the normal hacker-ish approach of trying to push our understanding of the underlying technology and protocols a bit further, not to mention, building on top of previous research certainly helps.\\n\\nFor defensive teams, Microsoft has previously published guidance regarding detecting and remediating Outlook rule and forms abuse,\\xa0[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/detect-and-remediate-outlook-rules-forms-attack?view=o365-worldwide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/detect-and-remediate-outlook-rules-forms-attack?view=o365-worldwide)\\n.\\n\\n### Timeline:\\n\\n*   Sept 29, 2023 – Vulnerability submitted to Microsoft.\\n*   Oct 2, 2023 – Microsoft opens case.\\n*   Oct 25, 2023 – Microsoft confirmed the behavior reported and states that they will continue their investigation and determine how to address this issue.\\n*   Feb 04, 2024 – Confirmation from Microsoft that a fix will be released in the following patching cycle.\\n*   Feb 13, 2024 – Fix for CVE-2024-21378 is released and case is closed.\\n*   Feb 28, 2024 – Errors in CVE FAQ and CVSS reported to Microsoft.\\n*   Mar 04, 2024 – Microsoft acknowledges they received the details and begins coordination with internal stakeholders.\\n*   Mar 05, 2024 – Microsoft updates CVE to address FAQ and CVSS errors.\\n*   Mar 11, 2024 –NetSPI published vulnerability and exploit details without the POC\\n*   Mar 18, 2024 – NetSPI published PoC\\n\\n### References:\\n\\n*   [https://github.com/sensepost/ruler](https://github.com/sensepost/ruler)\\n    \\n*   [https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21378](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21378)\\n    \\n*   [https://sensepost.com/blog/2016/mapi-over-http-and-mailrule-pwnage/](https://sensepost.com/blog/2016/mapi-over-http-and-mailrule-pwnage/)\\n    \\n*   [https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/pass-the-hash-with-ruler/](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/pass-the-hash-with-ruler/)\\n    \\n*   [https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-forms-and-shells/)\\n    \\n*   [https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-home-page-another-ruler-vector/](https://sensepost.com/blog/2017/outlook-home-page-another-ruler-vector/)\\n    \\n*   [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/outlook/concepts/forms/how-outlook-forms-and-items-work-together](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/outlook/concepts/forms/how-outlook-forms-and-items-work-together)\\n    \\n*   [https://github.com/rvrsh3ll/TokenTactics](https://github.com/rvrsh3ll/TokenTactics)\\n    \\n\\n### Authors:\\n\\n[![Headshot of Nick Landers](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Nick-Landers_SQ-1.jpg)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nNick Landers\\\\\\n\\\\\\nOffensive Security Researcher](/authors/nick-landers)\\n[![Headshot of Rich Wolferd](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Rich-Wolferd-1.jpg)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nRich Wolferd\\\\\\n\\\\\\nDirector, Red Team](/authors/rich-wolferd)\\n\\nExplore more blog posts\\n-----------------------\\n\\n[![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/073024_EXEC_AI-Security-Budgeting_Feature.webp)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nAdversarial Machine Learning\\\\\\n\\\\\\n### How to Navigate the Stiff-Arm When Protecting Your Generative AI Initiatives\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJuly 31, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\nLearn to effectively protect generative AI initiatives by integrating proactive security measures and gaining business buy-in for safer deployment.\\\\\\n\\\\\\nLearn More](https://www.netspi.com/blog/executive-blog/adversarial-machine-learning/how-to-navigate-the-stiff-arm-when-protecting-your-generative-ai-initiatives/)\\n[![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/073124_TECH_Google-Vulnerability-Disclosure_Feature.webp)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nCloud Pentesting\\\\\\n\\\\\\n### Escalating Privileges in Google Cloud via Open Groups\\xa0\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJuly 31, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\nLearn how attackers can abuse Open groups to potentially escalate privileges in Google Cloud and how to detect these attack paths.\\\\\\n\\\\\\nLearn More](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical-blog/cloud-pentesting/escalating-privileges-in-google-cloud-via-open-groups/)\\n[![](https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/072924_TECH_GCPwn_Feature.webp)\\\\\\n\\\\\\nCloud Pentesting\\\\\\n\\\\\\n### An Introduction to GCPwn – Part 1\\\\\\n\\\\\\nJuly 29, 2024\\\\\\n\\\\\\nGCPwn is a python-based framework for pentesting GCP environments.

11.0, and PAN-OS 11.1 firewalls configured with GlobalProtect gateway or GlobalProtect portal (or both). Device telemetry does not need to be enabled for PAN-OS firewalls to be exposed to attacks related to this vulnerability.\\n\\nYou can verify whether you have a GlobalProtect gateway or GlobalProtect portal configured by checking for entries in your firewall web interface (Network > GlobalProtect > Gateways or Network > GlobalProtect > Portals).\\n\\n### Severity: CRITICAL\\n\\nCVSSv4.0 Base Score: 10 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:M/U:Red](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:M/U:Red)\\n)\\n\\n### Exploitation Status\\n\\nPalo Alto Networks is aware of an increasing number of attacks that leverage the exploitation of this vulnerability. Proof of concepts for this vulnerability have been publicly disclosed by third parties.\\n\\nWe are also aware of proof-of-concept by third parties of post-exploit persistence techniques that survive resets and upgrades. We are not aware at this time of any malicious attempts to use these persistence techniques in active exploitation of the vulnerability. These fixes listed below and Threat Prevention signatures completely prevent the initial remote command execution, stopping subsequent post-exploitation or persistence.\\n\\nMore information about the vulnerability\\'s exploitation in the wild can be found in the Unit 42 threat brief ([https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-3400/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-3400/)\\n) and the Palo Alto Networks PSIRT blog post ([https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2024/04/more-on-the-pan-os-cve/](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2024/04/more-on-the-pan-os-cve/)\\n).\\n\\n### Weakness Type\\n\\n[CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\\'Command Injection\\')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77 \"More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77\")\\n\\n[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 \"More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\")\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nWe strongly advise customers to immediately upgrade to a fixed version of PAN-OS to protect their devices even when workarounds and mitigations have been applied.\\n\\nThis issue is fixed in PAN-OS 10.2.9-h1, PAN-OS 11.0.4-h1, PAN-OS 11.1.2-h3, and in all later PAN-OS versions. These fixes and those listed below completely prevent the initial remote command execution, stopping subsequent post-exploitation or persistence.\\n\\nIn addition, to provide the most seamless upgrade path for customers, additional hotfixes have been made available as a courtesy for other commonly deployed maintenance releases.\\n\\n`PAN-OS 10.2:`  \\n`- 10.2.9-h1 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.8-h3 (Released 4/15/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.7-h8 (Released 4/15/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.6-h3 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.5-h6 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.4-h16 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.3-h13 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.2-h5 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.1-h2 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.0-h3 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n  \\n`PAN-OS 11.0:`  \\n`- 11.0.4-h1 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.4-h2 (Released 4/17/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.3-h10 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.2-h4 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.1-h4 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.0-h3 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n  \\n`PAN-OS 11.1:`  \\n`- 11.1.2-h3 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 11.1.1-h1 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.1.0-h3 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n\\nNote: Due to naming convention limitations, “-h” hotfix versions on Azure marketplace are instead named via addition of an extra “0”. Ex: 11.1.2-h3 is published on Azure as 11.1.203.\\n\\nIf any exploitation was observed on a device, please take the remediation steps suggested here: [https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000CrO6CAK](https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000CrO6CAK)\\n\\nAn enhanced factory reset (EFR) procedure that does not rely on the integrity of a potentially compromised device can be scheduled by opening a case through Customer Support (TAC). This is recommended for:\\n\\n1\\\\. Customers who have not applied the PAN-OS fixes or Threat Prevention signatures with vulnerability protection applied to the GlobalProtect interface (regardless of level of compromise) on or before April 25, 2024; or\\n\\n2\\\\. Customers who are concerned about a persistent risk.\\n\\n### Workarounds and Mitigations\\n\\nRecommended Mitigation: Customers with a Threat Prevention subscription can block attacks for this vulnerability using Threat IDs 95187, 95189, and 95191 (available in Applications and Threats content version 8836-8695 and later). Please monitor this advisory and new Threat Prevention content updates for additional Threat Prevention IDs around CVE-2024-3400.\\n\\nTo apply the Threat IDs, customers must ensure that vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface to prevent exploitation of this issue on their device.

Proof of concepts for this vulnerability have been publicly disclosed by third parties.\\n\\nWe are also aware of proof-of-concept by third parties of post-exploit persistence techniques that survive resets and upgrades. We are not aware at this time of any malicious attempts to use these persistence techniques in active exploitation of the vulnerability. These fixes listed below and Threat Prevention signatures completely prevent the initial remote command execution, stopping subsequent post-exploitation or persistence.\\n\\nMore information about the vulnerability\\'s exploitation in the wild can be found in the Unit 42 threat brief ([https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-3400/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-3400/)\\n) and the Palo Alto Networks PSIRT blog post ([https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2024/04/more-on-the-pan-os-cve/](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2024/04/more-on-the-pan-os-cve/)\\n).\\n\\n### Weakness Type\\n\\n[CWE-77 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\\'Command Injection\\')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77 \"More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77\")\\n\\n[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 \"More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\")\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nWe strongly advise customers to immediately upgrade to a fixed version of PAN-OS to protect their devices even when workarounds and mitigations have been applied.\\n\\nThis issue is fixed in PAN-OS 10.2.9-h1, PAN-OS 11.0.4-h1, PAN-OS 11.1.2-h3, and in all later PAN-OS versions. These fixes and those listed below completely prevent the initial remote command execution, stopping subsequent post-exploitation or persistence.\\n\\nIn addition, to provide the most seamless upgrade path for customers, additional hotfixes have been made available as a courtesy for other commonly deployed maintenance releases.\\n\\n`PAN-OS 10.2:`  \\n`- 10.2.9-h1 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.8-h3 (Released 4/15/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.7-h8 (Released 4/15/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.6-h3 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.5-h6 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.4-h16 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.3-h13 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.2-h5 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.1-h2 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 10.2.0-h3 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n  \\n`PAN-OS 11.0:`  \\n`- 11.0.4-h1 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.4-h2 (Released 4/17/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.3-h10 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.2-h4 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.1-h4 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n`- 11.0.0-h3 (Released 4/18/24)`  \\n  \\n`PAN-OS 11.1:`  \\n`- 11.1.2-h3 (Released 4/14/24)`  \\n`- 11.1.1-h1 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n`- 11.1.0-h3 (Released 4/16/24)`  \\n\\nNote: Due to naming convention limitations, “-h” hotfix versions on Azure marketplace are instead named via addition of an extra “0”.

This is recommended for:\\n\\n1\\\\. Customers who have not applied the PAN-OS fixes or Threat Prevention signatures with vulnerability protection applied to the GlobalProtect interface (regardless of level of compromise) on or before April 25, 2024; or\\n\\n2\\\\. Customers who are concerned about a persistent risk.\\n\\n### Workarounds and Mitigations\\n\\nRecommended Mitigation: Customers with a Threat Prevention subscription can block attacks for this vulnerability using Threat IDs 95187, 95189, and 95191 (available in Applications and Threats content version 8836-8695 and later). Please monitor this advisory and new Threat Prevention content updates for additional Threat Prevention IDs around CVE-2024-3400.\\n\\nTo apply the Threat IDs, customers must ensure that vulnerability protection has been applied to their GlobalProtect interface to prevent exploitation of this issue on their device.
