        "\n",
        "##### Task\n",
        "Develop a co-pilot for threat researchers, security analysts, and professionals that addresses the limitations of current AI solutions like ChatGPT and Perplexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Current Challenges\n",
        "1. **Generic Data**: Existing AI solutions provide generic information that lacks specificity.\n",
        "2. **Context Understanding**: These solutions fail to understand and maintain context.\n",
        "3. **Limited Information**: The data sources are often limited and not comprehensive.\n",
        "4. **Single Source Dependency**: Relying on a single source of information reduces reliability and accuracy.\n",
        "5. **Inadequate AI Models**: Current models do not meet the specialized needs of cybersecurity professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Requirement\n",
        "Create a chatbot capable of collecting and curating data from multiple sources, starting with search engines, and expanding to website crawling and Twitter scraping.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### Technical Specifications\n",
        "- **No Hallucinations**: Ensure the chatbot provides accurate and reliable information.\n",
        "- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Use RAG to determine which connectors to use based on user inputs.\n",
        "- **Query Chunking and Distribution**: Optimize the process of breaking down queries and distributing them across different sources.\n",
        "- **Data Curation Steps**:\n",
        "  1. Collect links from approximately 50 sources.\n",
        "  2. Aggregate data from websites and Twitter.\n",
        "  3. Curate data using a knowledge graph to find relationships and generate responses.\n",
        "- **Chatbot Capabilities**: Answer queries such as:\n",
        "  - \"List all details on {{BFSI}} security incidents in {{India}}.\"\n",
        "  - \"List all ransomware attacks targeting the healthcare industry in {{last 7 days/last 3 months/last week/last month}}.\"\n",
        "  - \"Provide recent incidents related to Lockbit Ransomware gang / BlackBasta Ransomware.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Goal\n",
        "Develop a data collector that integrates multiple specific sources to enrich the knowledge base, enabling the model to better understand context and deliver accurate results. The solution should be modular, allowing customization and configuration of sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Summary\n",
        "The goal is to build an advanced, modular chatbot for cybersecurity professionals that overcomes the limitations of existing AI solutions by integrating multiple data sources and ensuring context-aware, accurate responses. The chatbot will utilize state-of-the-art techniques like RAG and knowledge graphs to provide comprehensive, curated information from diverse sources.\n"

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance.

Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software.

            "  \"text\": \"Krebs on Security \\u2013 In-depth security news and investigation Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content Home About the Author Advertising/Speaking Crooks Bypassed Google\\u2019s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services July 26, 2024 8 Comments Google says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a Google Workspace account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google\\u2019s \\u201cSign in with Google\\u201d feature. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password. Continue reading \\u2192 The Stark Truth Behind the Resurgence of Russia\\u2019s Fin7 July 10, 2024 17 Comments The Russia-based cybercrime group dubbed \\u201c Fin7 ,\\u201d known for phishing and malware attacks that have cost victim organizations an estimated $3 billion in losses since 2013, was declared dead last year by U.S. authorities. But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance.

In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

            "  \"text\": \"Krebs on Security \\u2013 In-depth security news and investigation Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content Home About the Author Advertising/Speaking Crooks Bypassed Google\\u2019s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services July 26, 2024 8 Comments Google says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a Google Workspace account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google\\u2019s \\u201cSign in with Google\\u201d feature. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch.

But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider.

The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

Benjamine Huffman, the director of DHS\\u2019s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), told police at the 2024 Border Security Expo in Texas that DHS is increasingly worried about criminals setting \\u201cbooby traps\\u201d with internet of things and smart home devices, and that NEO allows DHS to remotely disable the home networks of a home or building law enforcement is raiding. The Border Security Expo is open only to law enforcement and defense contractors. A transcript of Huffman\\u2019s speech was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\u2019s Dave Maass using a Freedom of Information Act request and was shared with 404 Media. \\u201cNEO can enter a potentially dangerous environment to provide video and audio feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to communicate with those in that environment,\\u201d Huffman said, according to the transcript. \\u201cNEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will allow officers the ability to create a \\u2018denial-of-service\\u2019 (DoS) event to disable \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 devices that could potentially cause harm while entry is made.\\u201d Slashdot thread .

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider.

The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

Benjamine Huffman, the director of DHS\\u2019s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), told police at the 2024 Border Security Expo in Texas that DHS is increasingly worried about criminals setting \\u201cbooby traps\\u201d with internet of things and smart home devices, and that NEO allows DHS to remotely disable the home networks of a home or building law enforcement is raiding. The Border Security Expo is open only to law enforcement and defense contractors. A transcript of Huffman\\u2019s speech was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\u2019s Dave Maass using a Freedom of Information Act request and was shared with 404 Media. \\u201cNEO can enter a potentially dangerous environment to provide video and audio feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to communicate with those in that environment,\\u201d Huffman said, according to the transcript. \\u201cNEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will allow officers the ability to create a \\u2018denial-of-service\\u2019 (DoS) event to disable \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 devices that could potentially cause harm while entry is made.\\u201d Slashdot thread .

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

            "  \"text\": \"Krebs on Security \\u2013 In-depth security news and investigation Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content Home About the Author Advertising/Speaking Crooks Bypassed Google\\u2019s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services July 26, 2024 8 Comments Google says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a Google Workspace account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google\\u2019s \\u201cSign in with Google\\u201d feature. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

A transcript of Huffman\\u2019s speech was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\u2019s Dave Maass using a Freedom of Information Act request and was shared with 404 Media. \\u201cNEO can enter a potentially dangerous environment to provide video and audio feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to communicate with those in that environment,\\u201d Huffman said, according to the transcript. \\u201cNEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will allow officers the ability to create a \\u2018denial-of-service\\u2019 (DoS) event to disable \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 devices that could potentially cause harm while entry is made.\\u201d Slashdot thread .

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance.

Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password. Continue reading \\u2192 The Stark Truth Behind the Resurgence of Russia\\u2019s Fin7 July 10, 2024 17 Comments The Russia-based cybercrime group dubbed \\u201c Fin7 ,\\u201d known for phishing and malware attacks that have cost victim organizations an estimated $3 billion in losses since 2013, was declared dead last year by U.S. authorities. But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js .

Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider.

The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations. It's safe to conclude that the way we The Essential Guide to Secure Workflow Automation for Security Teams Tines Cyber Security / Workflow Automation Learn how secure workflow automation (including AI-powered) could help solve your team's biggest challenges. 'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

            "  \"text\": \"Krebs on Security \\u2013 In-depth security news and investigation Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content Home About the Author Advertising/Speaking Crooks Bypassed Google\\u2019s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services July 26, 2024 8 Comments Google says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a Google Workspace account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google\\u2019s \\u201cSign in with Google\\u201d feature. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password. Continue reading \\u2192 The Stark Truth Behind the Resurgence of Russia\\u2019s Fin7 July 10, 2024 17 Comments The Russia-based cybercrime group dubbed \\u201c Fin7 ,\\u201d known for phishing and malware attacks that have cost victim organizations an estimated $3 billion in losses since 2013, was declared dead last year by U.S. authorities. But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider.

The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date?

The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit.

The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain.

Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password. Continue reading \\u2192 The Stark Truth Behind the Resurgence of Russia\\u2019s Fin7 July 10, 2024 17 Comments The Russia-based cybercrime group dubbed \\u201c Fin7 ,\\u201d known for phishing and malware attacks that have cost victim organizations an estimated $3 billion in losses since 2013, was declared dead last year by U.S. authorities. But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance.

In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil.

War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

Benjamine Huffman, the director of DHS\\u2019s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), told police at the 2024 Border Security Expo in Texas that DHS is increasingly worried about criminals setting \\u201cbooby traps\\u201d with internet of things and smart home devices, and that NEO allows DHS to remotely disable the home networks of a home or building law enforcement is raiding. The Border Security Expo is open only to law enforcement and defense contractors. A transcript of Huffman\\u2019s speech was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\u2019s Dave Maass using a Freedom of Information Act request and was shared with 404 Media. \\u201cNEO can enter a potentially dangerous environment to provide video and audio feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to communicate with those in that environment,\\u201d Huffman said, according to the transcript. \\u201cNEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will allow officers the ability to create a \\u2018denial-of-service\\u2019 (DoS) event to disable \\u2018Internet of Things\\u2019 devices that could potentially cause harm while entry is made.\\u201d Slashdot thread .

            "  \"text\": \"Krebs on Security \\u2013 In-depth security news and investigation Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content Home About the Author Advertising/Speaking Crooks Bypassed Google\\u2019s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services July 26, 2024 8 Comments Google says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a Google Workspace account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google\\u2019s \\u201cSign in with Google\\u201d feature. Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js . Continue reading \\u2192 Microsoft Patch Tuesday, July 2024 Edition July 9, 2024 24 Comments Microsoft Corp. today issued software updates to plug at least 139 security holes in various flavors of Windows and other Microsoft products. Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch.

But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider.

The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months.

The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it.

The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations.

'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance.

Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations. It's safe to conclude that the way we The Essential Guide to Secure Workflow Automation for Security Teams Tines Cyber Security / Workflow Automation Learn how secure workflow automation (including AI-powered) could help solve your team's biggest challenges. 'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year. Continue reading \\u2192 Advertisement Global Microsoft Meltdown Tied to Bad Crowdstrike Update July 19, 2024 95 Comments A faulty software update from cybersecurity vendor Crowdstrike crippled countless Microsoft Windows computers across the globe today, disrupting everything from airline travel and financial institutions to hospitals and businesses online. Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password. Continue reading \\u2192 The Stark Truth Behind the Resurgence of Russia\\u2019s Fin7 July 10, 2024 17 Comments The Russia-based cybercrime group dubbed \\u201c Fin7 ,\\u201d known for phishing and malware attacks that have cost victim organizations an estimated $3 billion in losses since 2013, was declared dead last year by U.S. authorities. But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js .

Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked. \\u201cIn the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,\\u201d the notice from Google read. \\u201cThese EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using \\u2018Sign In with Google\\u2019.\\u201d In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward. Anu Yamunan , director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved \\u201ca few thousand\\u201d Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified. Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services. \\u201cThe tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,\\u201d Yamunan said. \\u201cThe vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.\\u201d Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online. In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at Dropbox . Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace , which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains. On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn\\u2019t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published a statement blaming the domain hijacks on \\u201ca weakness related to OAuth logins\\u201d, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours. Phish-Friendly Domain Registry \\u201c.top\\u201d Put on Notice July 23, 2024 24 Comments The Chinese company in charge of handing out domain names ending in \\u201c .top \\u201d has been given until mid-August 2024 to show that it has put in place systems for managing phishing reports and suspending abusive domains, or else forfeit its license to sell domains. The warning comes amid the release of new findings that .top was the most common suffix in phishing websites over the past year, second only to domains ending in \\u201c.com.\\u201d Image: Shutterstock. On July 16, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) sent a letter to the owners of the .top domain registry. ICANN has filed hundreds of enforcement actions against domain registrars over the years, but in this case ICANN singled out a domain registry responsible for maintaining an entire top-level domain (TLD). Among other reasons, the missive chided the registry for failing to respond to reports about phishing attacks involving .top domains. \\u201cBased on the information and records gathered through several weeks, it was determined that .TOP Registry does not have a process in place to promptly, comprehensively, and reasonably investigate and act on reports of DNS Abuse,\\u201d the ICANN letter reads (PDF). ICANN\\u2019s warning redacted the name of the recipient, but records show the .top registry is operated by a Chinese entity called Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co. Ltd . Representatives for the company have not responded to requests for comment. Domains ending in .top were represented prominently in a new phishing report released today by the Interisle Consulting Group , which sources phishing data from several places, including the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), OpenPhish , PhishTank , and Spamhaus . Interisle\\u2019s newest study examined nearly two million phishing attacks in the last year, and found that phishing sites accounted for more than four percent of all new .top domains between May 2023 and April 2024. Interisle said .top has roughly 2.76 million domains in its stable, and that more than 117,000 of those were phishing sites in the past year. Source: Interisle Consulting Group. ICANN said its review was based on information collected and studied about .top domains over the past few weeks. But the fact that high volumes of phishing sites are being registered through Jiangsu Bangning Science & Technology Co Ltd. is hardly a new trend. For example, more than 10 years ago the same Chinese registrar was the fourth most common source of phishing websites, as tracked by the APWG. Bear in mind that the APWG report excerpted below was published more than a\\u00a0year before Jiangsu Bangning received ICANN approval to introduce and administer the new .top registry. Source: APWG phishing report from 2013, two years before .top came into being. A fascinating new wrinkle in the phishing landscape is the growth in scam pages hosted via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized data storage and delivery network that is based on peer-to-peer networking. According to Interisle, the use of IPFS to host and launch phishing attacks \\u2014 which can make phishing sites more difficult to take down \\u2014 increased a staggering 1,300 percent, to roughly 19,000 phishing sites reported in the last year.

Crowdstrike said a fix has been deployed, but experts say the recovery from this outage could take some time, as Crowdstrike\\u2019s solution needs to be applied manually on a per-machine basis. A photo taken at San Jose International Airport today shows the dreaded Microsoft \\u201cBlue Screen of Death\\u201d across the board. Credit: Twitter.com/adamdubya1990 Earlier today, an errant update shipped by Crowdstrike began causing Windows machines running the software to display the dreaded \\u201cBlue Screen of Death,\\u201d rendering those systems temporarily unusable. Like most security software, Crowdstrike requires deep hooks into the Windows operating system to fend off digital intruders, and in that environment a tiny coding error can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes. In a post on Twitter/X, Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz said an update to correct the coding mistake has been shipped, and that Mac and Linux systems are not affected. \\u201cThis is not a security incident or cyberattack,\\u201d Kurtz said on Twitter, echoing a written statement by Crowdstrike . \\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\\u201d Posting to Twitter/X, the director of Crowdstrike\\u2019s threat hunting operations said the fix involves booting Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), deleting the file \\u201cC-00000291*.sys\\u201d and then restarting the machine. The software snafu may have been compounded by a recent series of outages involving Microsoft\\u2019s Azure cloud services, The New York Times reports , although it remains unclear whether those Azure problems are at all related to the bad Crowdstrike update. Update, 4:03 p.m. ET: Microsoft reports the Azure problems today were unrelated to the bad Crowdstrike update. A reader shared this photo taken earlier today at Denver International Airport.

Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven\\u2019t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn\\u2019t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain. Until this past weekend, Squarespace\\u2019s website had an option to log in via email. The Squarespace domain hijacks, which took place between July 9 and July 12, appear to have mostly targeted cryptocurrency businesses, including Celer Network , Compound Finance , Pendle Finance , and Unstoppable Domains . In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors\\u2019 cryptocurrency funds. New York City-based Squarespace purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks. But an analysis released by security experts at Metamask and Paradigm finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options \\u2014 such \\u201cContinue with Google\\u201d or \\u201cContinue with Apple\\u201d \\u2014 as opposed to the \\u201cContinue with email\\u201d choice. Taylor Monahan , lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves. \\u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \\u201cAnd since there\\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \\u2018create password for your new account\\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password. \\u201cThe domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,\\u201d Monahan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace \\u2014 say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email \\u2014 anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.\\u201d Continue reading \\u2192 Crooks Steal Phone, SMS Records for Nearly All AT&T Customers July 12, 2024 50 Comments AT&T Corp. disclosed today that a new data breach has exposed phone call and text message records for roughly 110 million people \\u2014 nearly all of its customers. AT&T said it delayed disclosing the incident in response to \\u201cnational security and public safety concerns,\\u201d noting that some of the records included data that could be used to determine where a call was made or text message sent. AT&T also acknowledged the customer records were exposed in a cloud database that was protected only by a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today, AT&T said cyber intruders accessed an AT&T workspace on a third-party cloud platform in April, downloading files containing customer call and text interactions between May 1 and October 31, 2022, as well as on January 2, 2023. The company said the stolen data includes records of calls and texts for mobile providers that resell AT&T\\u2019s service, but that it does not include the content of calls or texts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or any other personally identifiable information. However, the company said a subset of stolen records included information about the location of cellular communications towers closest to the subscriber, data that could be used to determine the approximate location of the customer device initiating or receiving those text messages or phone calls. \\u201cWhile the data does not include customer names, there are often ways, using publicly available online tools, to find the name associated with a specific telephone number,\\u201d AT&T allowed. AT&T\\u2019s said it learned of the breach on April 19, but delayed disclosing it at the request of federal investigators. The company\\u2019s SEC disclosure says at least one individual has been detained by the authorities in connection with the breach. In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI confirmed that it asked AT&T to delay notifying affected customers. \\u201cShortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and before making its materiality decision, AT&T contacted the FBI to report the incident,\\u201d the FBI statement reads. \\u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\\u2019s incident response work.\\u201d Techcrunch quoted an AT&T spokesperson saying the customer data was stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving more than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake . Earlier this year, malicious hackers figured out that many major companies have uploaded massive amounts of valuable and sensitive customer data to Snowflake servers, all the while protecting those Snowflake accounts with little more than a username and password.

But experts say Fin7 has roared back to life in 2024 \\u2014 setting up thousands of websites mimicking a range of media and technology companies \\u2014 with the help of Stark Industries Solutions , a sprawling hosting provider that is a persistent source of cyberattacks against enemies of Russia. In May 2023, the U.S. attorney for Washington state declared \\u201cFin7 is an entity no more,\\u201d after prosecutors secured convictions and prison sentences against three men found to be high-level Fin7 hackers or managers. This was a bold declaration against a group that the U.S. Department of Justice described as a criminal enterprise with more than 70 people organized into distinct business units and teams. The first signs of Fin7\\u2019s revival came in April 2024, when Blackberry wrote about an intrusion at a large automotive firm that began with malware served by a typosquatting attack targeting people searching for a popular free network scanning tool. Now, researchers at security firm Silent Push say they have devised a way to map out Fin7\\u2019s rapidly regrowing cybercrime infrastructure, which includes more than 4,000 hosts that employ a range of exploits, from typosquatting and booby-trapped ads to malicious browser extensions and spearphishing domains. Silent Push said it found Fin7 domains targeting or spoofing brands including American Express , Affinity Energy , Airtable , Alliant , Android Developer , Asana , Bitwarden , Bloomberg , Cisco (Webex) , CNN , Costco , Dropbox , Grammarly , Google, Goto.com , Harvard , Lexis Nexis , Meta , Microsoft 365 , Midjourney , Netflix , Paycor , Quickbooks , Quicken , Reuters , Regions Bank Onepass , RuPay , SAP (Ariba) , Trezor , Twitter/X , Wall Street Journal , Westlaw , and Zoom , among others. Zach Edwards , senior threat analyst at Silent Push, said many of the Fin7 domains are innocuous-looking websites for generic businesses that sometimes include text from default website templates (the content on these sites often has nothing to do with the entity\\u2019s stated business or mission). Edwards said Fin7 does this to \\u201cage\\u201d the domains and to give them a positive or at least benign reputation before they\\u2019re eventually converted for use in hosting brand-specific phishing pages. \\u201cIt took them six to nine months to ramp up, but ever since January of this year they have been humming, building a giant phishing infrastructure and aging domains,\\u201d Edwards said of the cybercrime group. In typosquatting attacks, Fin7 registers domains that are similar to those for popular free software tools. Those look-alike domains are then advertised on Google so that sponsored links to them show up prominently in search results, which is usually above the legitimate source of the software in question. A malicious site spoofing FreeCAD showed up prominently as a sponsored result in Google search results earlier this year. According to Silent Push, the software currently being targeted by Fin7 includes 7-zip , PuTTY , ProtectedPDFViewer , AIMP , Notepad++ , Advanced IP Scanner , AnyDesk , pgAdmin , AutoDesk , Bitwarden , Rest Proxy , Python , Sublime Text , and Node.js .

Redmond says attackers are already exploiting at least two of the vulnerabilities in active attacks against Windows users. The first Microsoft zero-day this month is CVE-2024-38080 , a bug in the Windows Hyper-V component that affects Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 systems. CVE-2024-38080 allows an attacker to increase their account privileges on a Windows machine. Although Microsoft says this flaw is being exploited, it has offered scant details about its exploitation. The other zero-day is CVE-2024-38112 , which is a weakness in MSHTML , the proprietary engine of Microsoft\\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser. Kevin Breen , senior director of threat research at Immersive Labs , said exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 likely requires the use of an \\u201cattack chain\\u201d of exploits or programmatic changes on the target host, a la Microsoft\\u2019s description: \\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to take additional actions prior to exploitation to prepare the target environment.\\u201d \\u201cDespite the lack of details given in the initial advisory, this vulnerability affects all hosts from Windows Server 2008 R2 onwards, including clients,\\u201d Breen said. \\u201cDue to active exploitation in the wild this one should be prioritized for patching.\\u201d Satnam Narang , senior staff research engineer at Tenable , called special attention to CVE-2024-38021 , a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Office . Attacks on this weakness would lead to the disclosure of NTLM hashes, which could be leveraged as part of an NTLM relay or \\u201cpass the hash\\u201d attack, which lets an attacker masquerade as a legitimate user without ever having to log in. \\u201cOne of the more successful attack campaigns from 2023 used CVE-2023-23397, an elevation of privilege bug in Microsoft Outlook that could also leak NTLM hashes,\\u201d Narang said. \\u201cHowever, CVE-2024-38021 is limited by the fact that the Preview Pane is not an attack vector, which means that exploitation would not occur just by simply previewing the file.\\u201d The security firm Morphisec , credited with reporting CVE-2024-38021 to Microsoft, said it respectfully disagrees with Microsoft\\u2019s \\u201cimportant\\u201d severity rating, arguing the Office flaw deserves a more dire \\u201ccritical\\u201d rating given how easy it is for attackers to exploit. \\u201cTheir assessment differentiates between trusted and untrusted senders, noting that while the vulnerability is zero-click for trusted senders, it requires one click user interaction for untrusted senders,\\u201d Morphisec\\u2019s Michael Gorelik said in a blog post about their discovery . \\u201cThis reassessment is crucial to reflect the true risk and ensure adequate attention and resources are allocated for mitigation.\\u201d In last month\\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft fixed a flaw in its Windows WiFi driver that attackers could use to install malicious software just by sending a vulnerable Windows host a specially crafted data packet over a local network. Jason Kikta at Automox said this month\\u2019s CVE-2024-38053 \\u2014 a security weakness in Windows Layer Two Bridge Network \\u2014 is another local network \\u201cping-of-death\\u201d vulnerability that should be a priority for road warriors to patch. Continue reading \\u2192 The Not-So-Secret Network Access Broker x999xx July 3, 2024 18 Comments Most accomplished cybercriminals go out of their way to separate their real names from their hacker handles. But among certain old-school Russian hackers it is not uncommon to find major players who have done little to prevent people from figuring out who they are in real life. A case study in this phenomenon is \\u201c x999xx ,\\u201d the nickname chosen by a venerated Russian hacker who specializes in providing the initial network access to various ransomware groups. x999xx is a well-known \\u201caccess broker\\u201d who frequently sells access to hacked corporate networks \\u2014 usually in the form of remote access credentials \\u2014 as well as compromised databases containing large amounts of personal and financial data. In an analysis published in February 2019, cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint called x999xx one of the most senior and prolific members of the top-tier Russian-language cybercrime forum Exploit , where x999xx could be seen frequently advertising the sale of stolen databases and network credentials. In August 2023, x999xx sold access to a company that develops software for the real estate industry. In July 2023, x999xx advertised the sale of Social Security numbers, names, and birthdays for the citizenry of an entire U.S. state (unnamed in the auction). A month earlier, x999xx posted a sales thread for 80 databases taken from Australia\\u2019s largest retail company. \\u201cYou may use this data to demand a ransom or do something different with it,\\u201d x999xx wrote on Exploit. \\u201cUnfortunately, the flaw was patched fast. [+] no one has used the data yet [+] the data hasn\\u2019t been used to send spam [+] the data is waiting for its time.\\u201d In October 2022, x999xx sold administrative access to a U.S. healthcare provider. Continue reading \\u2192 KrebsOnSecurity Threatened with Defamation Lawsuit Over Fake Radaris CEO June 20, 2024 106 Comments On March 8, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the consumer data broker Radaris , showing how the original owners are two men in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites. The subjects of that piece are threatening to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story is retracted. Meanwhile, their attorney has admitted that the person Radaris named as the CEO from its inception is a fabricated identity. Radaris is just one cog in a sprawling network of people-search properties online that sell highly detailed background reports on U.S. consumers and businesses. Those reports typically include the subject\\u2019s current and previous addresses, partial Social Security numbers, any known licenses, email addresses and phone numbers, as well as the same information for any of their immediate relatives. Radaris has a less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to responding to consumers seeking to have their reports removed from its various people-search services. That poor reputation, combined with indications that the true founders of Radaris have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their stewardship of the company, was what prompted KrebsOnSecurity to investigate the origins of Radaris in the first place. On April 18, KrebsOnSecurity received a certified letter (PDF) from Valentin \\u201cVal\\u201d Gurvits , an attorney with the Boston Law Group , stating that KrebsOnSecurity would face a withering defamation lawsuit unless the Radaris story was immediately retracted and an apology issued to the two brothers named in the story as co-founders. That March story worked backwards from the email address used to register radaris.com, and charted an impressive array of data broker companies created over the past 15 years by Massachusetts residents Dmitry and Igor Lubarsky (also sometimes spelled Lybarsky or Lubarski). Dmitry goes by \\u201c Dan ,\\u201d and Igor uses the name \\u201c Gary .\\u201d Those businesses included numerous websites marketed to Russian-speaking people who are new to the United States, such as russianamerica.com, newyork.ru, russiancleveland.com, russianla.com, russianmiami.com, etc. Other domains connected to the Lubarskys included Russian-language dating and adult websites, as well as affiliate programs for their international calling card businesses. A mind map of various entities apparently tied to Radaris and the company\\u2019s co-founders. Click to enlarge. The story on Radaris noted that the Lubarsky brothers registered most of their businesses using a made-up name \\u2014 \\u201c Gary Norden ,\\u201d sometimes called Gary Nord or Gary Nard . Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 letter stated emphatically that my reporting was lazy, mean-spirited, and obviously intended to smear the reputation of his clients. By way of example, Mr. Gurvits said the Lubarskys were actually Ukrainian, and that the story painted his clients in a negative light by insinuating that they were somehow associated with Radaris and with vaguely nefarious elements in Russia. But more to the point, Mr. Gurvits said, neither of his clients were Gary Norden, and neither had ever held any leadership positions at Radaris, nor were they financial beneficiaries of the company in any way. \\u201cNeither of my clients is a founder of Radaris, and neither of my clients is the CEOs of Radaris,\\u201d Gurvits wrote. \\u201cAdditionally, presently and going back at least the past 10 years, neither of my clients are (or were) officers or employees of Radaris. Indeed, neither of them even owns (or ever owned) any equity in Radaris. In intentional disregard of these facts, the Article implies that my clients are personally responsible for Radaris\\u2019 actions. Therefore, you intentionally caused all negative allegations in the Article made with respect to Radaris to be imputed against my clients personally.\\u201d Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s Facebook page, just prior to the March 8 story about Radaris, said he was from Moscow. We took Mr. Gurvits\\u2019 word on the ethnicity of his clients, and adjusted the story to remove a single mention that they were Russian. We did so even though Dan Lubarsky\\u2019s own Facebook page said (until recently) that he was from Moscow, Russia. KrebsOnSecurity asked Mr. Gurvits to explain precisely which other details in the story were incorrect, and replied that we would be happy to update the story with a correction if they could demonstrate any errors of fact or omission. We also requested specifics about several aspects of the story, such as the identity of the current Radaris CEO \\u2014 listed on the Radaris website as \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Mr. Gurvits replied that Radaris is and always has been based in Ukraine, and that the company\\u2019s true founder \\u201cEugene L\\u201d is based there. While Radaris has claimed to have offices in Massachusetts, Cyprus and Latvia, its website has never mentioned Ukraine. Mr. Gurvits has not responded to requests for more information about the identities of \\u201cEugene L\\u201d or \\u201cVictor K.\\u201d Gurvits said he had no intention of doing anyone\\u2019s reporting for them, and that the Lubarskys were going to sue KrebsOnSecurity for defamation unless the story was retracted in full. KrebsOnSecurity replied that journalists often face challenges to things that they report, but it is more than rare for one who makes a challenge to take umbrage at being asked for supporting information. On June 13, Mr. Gurvits sent another letter (PDF) that continued to claim KrebsOnSecurity was defaming his clients, only this time Gurvits said his clients would be satisfied if KrebsOnSecurity just removed their names from the story. \\u201cUltimately, my clients don\\u2019t care what you say about any of the websites or corporate entities in your Article, as long as you completely remove my clients\\u2019 names from the Article and cooperate with my clients to have copies of the Article where my clients\\u2019 names appear removed from the Internet,\\u201d Mr. Gurvits wrote. MEET THE FAKE RADARIS CEO The June 13 letter explained that the name Gary Norden was a pseudonym invented by the Radaris marketing division, but that neither of the Lubarsky brothers were Norden. This was a startling admission, given that Radaris has quoted the fictitious Gary Norden in press releases published and paid for by Radaris, and in news media stories where the company is explicitly seeking money from investors. In other words, Radaris has been misrepresenting itself to investors from the beginning. Here\\u2019s a press release from Radaris that was published on PR Newswire in April 2011: A press release published by Radaris in 2011 names the CEO of Radaris as Gary Norden, which was a fake name made up by Radaris\\u2019 marketing department. In April 2014, the Boston Business Journal published a story (PDF) about Radaris that extolled the company\\u2019s rapid growth and considerable customer base. The story noted that, \\u201cto date, the company has raised less than $1 million from Cyprus-based investment company Difive .\\u201d \\u201cWe live in a world where information becomes much more broad and much more available every single day,\\u201d the Boston Business Journal quoted Radaris\\u2019 fake CEO Gary Norden, who by then had somehow been demoted from CEO to vice president of business development. A Boston Business Journal story from April 2014 quotes the fictitious Radaris CEO Gary Norden. \\u201cWe decided there needs to be a service that allows for ease of monitoring of information about people,\\u201d the fake CEO said. The story went on to say Radaris was seeking to raise between $5 million and $7 million from investors in the ensuing months. Continue reading \\u2192 Alleged Boss of \\u2018Scattered Spider\\u2019 Hacking Group Arrested June 15, 2024 10 Comments A 22-year-old man from the United Kingdom arrested this week in Spain is allegedly the ringleader of Scattered Spider , a cybercrime group suspected of hacking into Twilio , LastPass , DoorDash , Mailchimp , and nearly 130 other organizations over the past two years. The Spanish daily Murcia Today reports the suspect was wanted by the FBI and arrested in Palma de Mallorca as he tried to board a flight to Italy. A still frame from a video released by the Spanish national police shows Tylerb in custody at the airport. \\u201cHe stands accused of hacking into corporate accounts and stealing critical information, which allegedly enabled the group to access multi-million-dollar funds,\\u201d Murcia Today wrote . \\u201cAccording to Palma police, at one point he controlled Bitcoins worth $27 million.\\u201d The cybercrime-focused Twitter/X account vx-underground said the U.K. man arrested was a SIM-swapper who went by the alias \\u201c Tyler .\\u201d In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target\\u2019s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls sent to the victim \\u2014 including one-time passcodes for authentication, or password reset links sent via SMS. \\u201cHe is a known SIM-swapper and is allegedly involved with the infamous Scattered Spider group,\\u201d vx-underground wrote on June 15, referring to a prolific gang implicated in costly data ransom attacks at MGM and Caesars casinos in Las Vegas last year. Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the accused is a 22-year-old from Dundee, Scotland named Tyler Buchanan , also allegedly known as \\u201c tylerb \\u201d on Telegram chat channels centered around SIM-swapping. In January 2024, U.S. authorities arrested another alleged Scattered Spider member \\u2014 19-year-old Noah Michael Urban of Palm Coast, Fla. \\u2014 and charged him with stealing at least $800,000 from five victims between August 2022 and March 2023. Urban allegedly went by the nicknames \\u201c Sosa \\u201d and \\u201c King Bob, \\u201d and is believed to be part of the same crew that hacked Twilio and a slew of other companies in 2022. Investigators say Scattered Spider members are part of a more diffuse cybercriminal community online known as \\u201c The Com ,\\u201d wherein hackers from different cliques boast loudly about high-profile cyber thefts that almost invariably begin with social engineering \\u2014 tricking people over the phone, email or SMS into giving away credentials that allow remote access to corporate internal networks. One of the more popular SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintains a frequently updated leaderboard of the most accomplished SIM-swappers, indexed by their supposed conquests in stealing cryptocurrency. That leaderboard currently lists Sosa as #24 (out of 100), and Tylerb at #65.

These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames. Such tools work because a digital camera\\u2019s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop. But because AI-generated videos aren\\u2019t produced by a camera capturing a real scene or image, they don\\u2019t contain those telltale disparities between pixel values. The Drexel team\\u2019s tools, including MISLnet, learn using a method called a constrained neural network, which can differentiate between normal and unusual values at the sub-pixel level of images or video clips, rather than searching for the common indicators of image manipulation like those mentioned above.

The cause: a cryptographic key underpinning Secure Boot on those models that was compromised in 2022. In a public GitHub repository committed in December of that year, someone working for multiple US-based device manufacturers published what\\u2019s known as a platform key, the cryptographic key that forms the root-of-trust anchor between the hardware device and the firmware that runs on it. The repository was located at https://github.com/raywu-aaeon/Ryzen2000_4000.git, and it\\u2019s not clear when it was taken down. The repository included the private portion of the platform key in encrypted form. The encrypted file, however, was protected by a four-character password, a decision that made it trivial for Binarly, and anyone else with even a passing curiosity, to crack the passcode and retrieve the corresponding plain text. The disclosure of the key went largely unnoticed until January 2023, when Binarly researchers found it while investigating a supply-chain incident. Now that the leak has come to light, security experts say it effectively torpedoes the security assurances offered by Secure Boot. [\\u2026] These keys were created by AMI, one of the three main providers of software developer kits that device makers use to customize their UEFI firmware so it will run on their specific hardware configurations. As the strings suggest, the keys were never intended to be used in production systems. Instead, AMI provided them to customers or prospective customers for testing. For reasons that aren\\u2019t clear, the test keys made their way into devices from a nearly inexhaustive roster of makers. In addition to the five makers mentioned earlier, they include Aopen, Foremelife, Fujitsu, HP, Lenovo, and Supermicro.

Nearly 7,000 flights were canceled . It took down 911 systems and factories, courthouses, and television stations. Tallying the total cost will take time. The outage affected more than 8.5 million Windows computers, and the cost will surely be in the billions of dollars \\u00adeasily matching the most costly previous cyberattacks, such as NotPetya . The catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. It\\u2019s complex, deeply interconnected, and filled with single points of failure. As we experienced last week, a single problem in a small piece of software can take large swaths of the internet and global economy offline. The brittleness of modern society isn\\u2019t confined to tech. We can see it in many parts of our infrastructure, from food to electricity , from finance to transportation . This is often a result of globalization and consolidation, but not always. In information technology, brittleness also results from the fact that hundreds of companies, none of which you;ve heard of, each perform a small but essential role in keeping the internet running. CrowdStrike is one of those companies. This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing\\u2014as opposed to personal computing\\u2014a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, to have as deep access into their customers\\u2019 networks as possible, and to run as leanly as possible. Redundancies are unprofitable. Being slow and careful is unprofitable. Being less embedded in and less essential and having less access to the customers\\u2019 networks and machines is unprofitable\\u2014at least in the short term, by which these companies are measured. This is true for companies like CrowdStrike. It\\u2019s also true for CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers, who also didn\\u2019t have resilience, redundancy, or backup systems in place for failures such as this because they are also an expense that affects short-term profitability. But brittleness is profitable only when everything is working. When a brittle system fails, it fails badly. The cost of failure to a company like CrowdStrike is a fraction of the cost to the global economy. And there will be a next CrowdStrike, and one after that. The market rewards short-term profit-maximizing systems, and doesn\\u2019t sufficiently penalize such companies for the impact their mistakes can have. ( Stock prices depress only temporarily. Regulatory penalties are minor. Class-action lawsuits settle. Insurance blunts financial losses.) It\\u2019s not even clear that the information technology industry could exist in its current form if it had to take into account all the risks such brittleness causes. The asymmetry of costs is largely due to our complex interdependency on so many systems and technologies, any one of which can cause major failures. Each piece of software depends on dozens of others, typically written by other engineering teams sometimes years earlier on the other side of the planet. Some software systems have not been properly designed to contain the damage caused by a bug or a hack of some key software dependency. These failures can take many forms. The CrowdStrike failure was the result of a buggy software update . The bug didn\\u2019t get caught in testing and was rolled out to CrowdStrike\\u2019s customers worldwide. Sometimes, failures are deliberate results of a cyberattack. Other failures are just random, the result of some unforeseen dependency between different pieces of critical software systems . Imagine a house where the drywall, flooring, fireplace, and light fixtures are all made by companies that need continuous access and whose failures would cause the house to collapse. You\\u2019d never set foot in such a structure, yet that\\u2019s how software systems are built. It\\u2019s not that 100 percent of the system relies on each company all the time, but 100 percent of the system can fail if any one of them fails. But doing better is expensive and doesn\\u2019t immediately contribute to a company\\u2019s bottom line. Economist Ronald Coase famously described the nature of the firm\\u00ad\\u2014any business\\u00ad\\u2014as a collection of contracts. Each contract has a cost. Performing the same function in-house also has a cost. When the costs of maintaining the contract are lower than the cost of doing the thing in-house, then it makes sense to outsource: to another firm down the street or, in an era of cheap communication and coordination, to another firm on the other side of the planet. The problem is that both the financial and risk costs of outsourcing can be hidden\\u2014delayed in time and masked by complexity\\u2014and can lead to a false sense of security when companies are actually entangled by these invisible dependencies. The ability to outsource software services became easy a little over a decade ago, due to ubiquitous global network connectivity, cloud and software-as-a-service business models, and an increase in industry- and government-led certifications and box-checking exercises. This market force has led to the current global interdependence of systems, far and wide beyond their industry and original scope. It\\u2019s why flying planes depends on software that has nothing to do with the avionics. It\\u2019s why, in our connected internet-of-things world, we can imagine a similar bad software update resulting in our cars not starting one morning or our refrigerators failing. This is not something we can dismantle overnight. We have built a society based on complex technology that we\\u2019re utterly dependent on, with no reliable way to manage that technology. Compare the internet with ecological systems. Both are complex, but ecological systems have deep complexity rather than just surface complexity. In ecological systems, there are fewer single points of failure: If any one thing fails in a healthy natural ecosystem, there are other things that will take over. That gives them a resilience that our tech systems lack. We need deep complexity in our technological systems, and that will require changes in the market. Right now, the market incentives in tech are to focus on how things succeed: A company like CrowdStrike provides a key service that checks off required functionality on a compliance checklist, which makes it all about the features that they will deliver when everything is working. That;s exactly backward. We want our technological infrastructure to mimic nature in the way things fail. That will give us deep complexity rather than just surface complexity, and resilience rather than brittleness. How do we accomplish this? There are examples in the technology world, but they are piecemeal. Netflix is famous for its Chaos Monkey tool , which intentionally causes failures to force the systems (and, really, the engineers) to be more resilient. The incentives don\\u2019t line up in the short term: It makes it harder for Netflix engineers to do their jobs and more expensive for them to run their systems. Over years, this kind of testing generates more stable systems. But it requires corporate leadership with foresight and a willingness to spend in the short term for possible long-term benefits. Last week\\u2019s update wouldn\\u2019t have been a major failure if CrowdStrike had rolled out this change incrementally : first 1 percent of their users, then 10 percent, then everyone. But that\\u2019s much more expensive, because it requires a commitment of engineer time for monitoring, debugging, and iterating. And can take months to do correctly for complex and mission-critical software. An executive today will look at the market incentives and correctly conclude that it\\u2019s better for them to take the chance than to \\u201cwaste\\u201d the time and money. The usual tools of regulation and certification may be inadequate, because failure of complex systems is inherently also complex. We can\\u2019t describe the unknown unknowns involved in advance. Rather, what we need to codify are the processes by which failure testing must take place. We know, for example, how to test whether cars fail well. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crashes cars to learn what happens to the people inside. But cars are relatively simple, and keeping people safe is straightforward. Software is different. It is diverse, is constantly changing, and has to continually adapt to novel circumstances. We can\\u2019t expect that a regulation that mandates a specific list of software crash tests would suffice. Again, security and resilience are achieved through the process by which we fail and fix, not through any specific checklist. Regulation has to codify that process. Today\\u2019s internet systems are too complex to hope that if we are smart and build each piece correctly the sum total will work right. We have to deliberately break things and keep breaking them. This repeated process of breaking and fixing will make these systems reliable. And then a willingness to embrace inefficiencies will make these systems resilient. But the economic incentives point companies in the other direction, to build their systems as brittle as they can possibly get away with.

This week, we announced a digital wallet based on the Solid architecture. Details are here , but basically a digital wallet is a repository for personal data and documents. Right now, there are hundreds of different wallets, but no standard. We think designing a wallet around Solid makes sense for lots of reasons. A wallet is more than a data store\\u2014data in wallets is for using and sharing. That requires interoperability, which is what you get from an open standard. It also requires fine-grained permissions and robust security, and that\\u2019s what the Solid protocols provide. I think of Solid as a set of protocols for decoupling applications, data, and security. That\\u2019s the sort of thing that will make digital wallets work.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-45249 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns a case of remote code execution that stems from the use of default passwords. The flaw impacts the following versions of Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) - < build 5.0.1-61 < build 5.1.1-71 < build 5.2.1-69 < build 5.3.1-53, and\\u00a0 < build 5.4.4-132 It has been addressed in versions 5.4 update 4.2, 5.2 update 1.3, 5.3 update 1.3, 5.0 update 1.4, and 5.1 update 1.2 released in late October 2023. There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being weaponized in real-world cyber attacks and the identity of the threat actors that may be exploiting it. However, the Swiss-headquartered company acknowledged reports of active exploitation in an updated advisory last week. \\\"This vulnerability is known to be exploi Proofpoint Email Routing Flaw Exploited to Send Millions of Spoofed Phishing Emails \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Email Security / Hacking An unknown threat actor has been linked to a massive scam campaign that exploited an email routing misconfiguration in email security vendor Proofpoint's defenses to send millions of messages spoofing various popular companies like Best Buy, IBM, Nike, and Walt Disney, among others. \\\"These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures , thus bypassing major security protections \\u2014 all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details,\\\" Guardio Labs researcher Nati Tal said in a detailed report shared with The Hacker News. The cybersecurity company has given the campaign the name EchoSpoofing . The activity is believed to have commenced in January 2024, with the threat actor exploiting the loophole to send as many as three million emails per day on average, a number that hit a peak of 14 million in early June as Proofpoint began to enact countermeasures. \\\"The most unique and powerful part of this domain How Searchable Encryption Changes the Data Security Game \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Data Security / Encryption Searchable Encryption has long been a mystery. An oxymoron. An unattainable dream of cybersecurity professionals everywhere. Organizations know they must encrypt their most valuable, sensitive data to prevent data theft and breaches. They also understand that organizational data exists to be used. To be searched, viewed, and modified to keep businesses running. Unfortunately, our Network and Data Security Engineers were taught for decades that you just can't search or edit data while in an encrypted state. The best they could do was to wrap that plaintext, unencrypted data within a cocoon of complex hardware, software, policies, controls, and governance. And how has that worked to date? Just look at the T-Mobile breach, the United Healthcare breach, Uber, Verizon, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Bank of America, Prudential\\u2026 and the list goes on. All the data that was stolen in those breaches remained unencrypted to support day-to-day operations. It's safe to conclude that the way we The Essential Guide to Secure Workflow Automation for Security Teams Tines Cyber Security / Workflow Automation Learn how secure workflow automation (including AI-powered) could help solve your team's biggest challenges. 'Stargazer Goblin' Creates 3,000 Fake GitHub Accounts for Malware Spread \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Malware / Network Security A threat actor known as Stargazer Goblin has set up a network of inauthentic GitHub accounts to fuel a Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) that propagates a variety of information-stealing malware and netting them $100,000 in illicit profits over the past year. The network, which comprises over 3,000 accounts on the cloud-based code hosting platform, spans thousands of repositories that are used to share malicious links or malware, per Check Point, which has dubbed it \\\"Stargazers Ghost Network.\\\" Some of the malware families propagated using this method include Atlantida Stealer, Rhadamanthys, RisePro, Lumma Stealer, and RedLine, with the bogus accounts also engaged in starring, forking, watching, and subscribing to malicious repositories to give them a veneer of legitimacy. The network is believed to have been active since August 2022 in some preliminary form, although an advertisement for the DaaS wasn't spotted in the dark until early July 2023. \\\"Threat actors no Gh0st RAT Trojan Targets Chinese Windows Users via Fake Chrome Site \\ue802 Jul 29, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cyber Espionage The remote access trojan known as Gh0st RAT has been observed being delivered by an \\\"evasive dropper\\\" called Gh0stGambit as part of a drive-by download scheme targeting Chinese-speaking Windows users. These infections stem from a fake website (\\\"chrome-web[.]com\\\") serving malicious installer packages masquerading as Google's Chrome browser, indicating that users searching for the software on the web are being singled out. Gh0st RAT is a long-standing malware that has been observed in the wild since 2008, manifesting in the form of different variants over the years in campaigns primarily orchestrated by China-nexus cyberespionage groups. Some iterations of the trojan have also been previously deployed by infiltrating poorly-secured MS SQL server instances, using it as a conduit to install the Hidden open-source rootkit. According to cybersecurity firm eSentire, which discovered the latest activity, the targeting of Chinese-speaking users is based on &quo French Authorities Launch Operation to Remove PlugX Malware from Infected Systems \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Malware / Cyber Intelligence French judicial authorities, in collaboration with Europol, have launched a so-called \\\"disinfection operation\\\" to rid compromised hosts of a known malware called PlugX. The Paris Prosecutor's Office, Parquet de Paris, said the initiative was launched on July 18 and that it's expected to continue for \\\"several months.\\\" It further said around a hundred victims located in France, Malta, Portugal, Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria have already benefited from the cleanup efforts. The development comes nearly three months after French cybersecurity firm Sekoia disclosed it sinkholed a command-and-control (C2) server linked to the PlugX trojan in September 2023 by spending $7 to acquire the IP address. It also noted that nearly 100,000 unique public IP addresses have been sending PlugX requests daily to the seized domain. PlugX (aka Korplug) is a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by China-nexus threat actors since at least 2008, alongside other malware fam How to Increase Engagement with Your Cybersecurity Clients Through vCISO Reporting \\ue802 Jul 22, 2024 vCISO / Business Security As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, \\\"Your First 100 Days as a vCISO \\u2013 5 Steps to Success\\\" , which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.\\u00a0 Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.\\u00a0 This article brings the highlights of a recent guided workshop we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients. Malicious PyPI Package Targets macOS to Steal Google Cloud Credentials \\ue802 Jul 27, 2024 Cybersecurity / Cloud Security Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that targets Apple macOS systems with the goal of stealing users' Google Cloud credentials from a narrow pool of victims. The package, named \\\"lr-utils-lib,\\\" attracted a total of 59 downloads before it was taken down. It was uploaded to the registry in early June 2024. \\\"The malware uses a list of predefined hashes to target specific macOS machines and attempts to harvest Google Cloud authentication data,\\\" Checkmarx researcher Yehuda Gelb said in a Friday report. \\\"The harvested credentials are sent to a remote server.\\\" An important aspect of the package is that it first checks if it has been installed on a macOS system, and only then proceeds to compare the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) against a hard-coded list of 64 hashes. If the compromised machine is among those specified in the predefined set, it attempts to access This AI-Powered Cybercrime Service Bundles Phishing Kits with Malicious Android Apps \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Cybercrime / Mobile Security A Spanish-speaking cybercrime group named GXC Team has been observed bundling phishing kits with malicious Android applications, taking malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings to the next level. Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB, which has been tracking the e-crime actor since January 2023, described the crimeware solution as a \\\"sophisticated AI-powered phishing-as-a-service platform\\\" capable of targeting users of more than 36 Spanish banks, governmental bodies, and 30 institutions worldwide. The phishing kit is priced anywhere between $150 and $900 a month, whereas the bundle including the phishing kit and Android malware is available on a subscription basis for about $500 per month. Targets of the campaign include users of Spanish financial institutions, as well as tax and governmental services, e-commerce, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, the United Kingdom, Slovakia, and Brazil. As many as 288 phishing domains linked to the activity ha Offensive AI: The Sine Qua Non of Cybersecurity \\ue802 Jul 26, 2024 Digital Warfare / Cybersecurity Training \\\"Peace is the virtue of civilization. War is its crime. Yet it is often in the furnace of war that the sharpest tools of peace are forged.\\\" - Victor Hugo. In 1971, an unsettling message started appearing on several computers that comprised ARPANET, the precursor to what we now know as the Internet. The message, which read \\\"I'm the Creeper: catch me if you can.\\\" was the output of a program named Creeper, which was developed by the famous programmer Bob Thomas while he worked at BBN Technologies. While Thomas's intentions were not malicious, the Creeper program represents the advent of what we now call a computer virus. The appearance of Creeper on ARPANET set the stage for the emergence of the first Antivirus software. While unconfirmed, it is believed that Ray Thomlinson, famously known for inventing email, developed Reaper, a program designed to remove Creeper from Infected Machines.
