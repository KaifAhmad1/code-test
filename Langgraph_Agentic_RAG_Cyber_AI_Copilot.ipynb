Soon it was blocked for falling foul of the Telegram terms of service. The group stayed off the radar for several months, but as we investigated a late June 2024 attack, we found that it employed techniques identical to those of Twelve and relied on C2 servers linked to the threat actor. We are therefore confident that the group is still active and will probably soon resurface. This article uses the Unified Kill Chain methodology to analyze the attackers’ actions.\n",

In addition, Twelve exfiltrates sensitive information from its victims’ systems and posts it on its Telegram channel.\n",

At the same time, whereas Twelve’s actions are clearly hacktivist in nature, DARKSTAR sticks to the classic double extortion pattern. This variation of objectives within the syndicate underscores the complexity and diversity of modern cyberthreats.\n",

            "Resource Development\n",
            "As we analyzed the cyberattacks, we found that the threat actor relied exclusively on well-known and freely available tools. The tools frequently used by the group include Cobalt Strike, mimikatz, chisel, BloodHound, PowerView, adPEAS, CrackMapExec, Advanced IP Scanner and PsExec.\n",
            "Initial Access and Delivery\n",
            "In most of the attacks we are aware of, the adversary gained initial access to victims’ infrastructure through valid local or domain accounts, VPN or SSH certificates. After gaining access to the victim’s infrastructure, the attackers used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally.\n",
            "Most times, the attackers penetrated the target infrastructure via some of the victim’s contractors. To do this, they gained access to the contractor’s infrastructure and then used its certificate to connect to its customer’s VPN. Having obtained access to that, the adversary can connect to the customer’s systems via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then penetrate the customer’s infrastructure.\n",

            "Text: AUSTIN, Texas– A Ukrainian national pleaded guilty in federal court in Austin today to one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. According to court documents, Mark Sokolovsky, 28, conspired to operate the Raccoon Infostealer as a malware-as-a-service or “MaaS.” Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency. These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims. Raccoon Infostealer then stole personal data from victim computers, including log-in credentials, financial information, and other personal records. Stolen information was used to commit financial crimes or was sold to others on cybercrime forums. In March 2022, concurrent with Sokolovsky’s arrest by Dutch authorities, the FBI and law enforcement partners in Italy and the Netherlands dismantled the digital infrastructure supporting the Raccoon Infostealer, taking its then existing version offline. Sokolovsky was extradited to the United States from the Netherlands in February 2024 after being indicted for crimes related to fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. As part of the plea, he agreed to a forfeiture money judgment of $23,975 and restitution of at least $910,844.61. U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas made the announcement of the defendant’s plea. The FBI’s Austin Cyber Task Force is investigating the case with the assistance of the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division (Army CID), the Austin Police Department, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the Round Rock Police Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety.

            "Text: Infostealer attacks are becoming an increasingly serious threat. Over the past few years, infostealer malware has increasingly become the weapon of choice for cybercriminals as a low-hanging fruit tactic to carry out high-impact data breaches due to their simplicity, vast availability, and low cost. The Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Intelligence team recently discovered a new version of the SYS01 infostealer during our ongoing research of malicious activity on Facebook. With over 2.9 billion monthly active users and 200 million business accounts on Facebook, this infostealer poses a significant risk. In this campaign, hackers use malicious advertisements to steal account credentials to take over Facebook business and personal pages, as well as gain access to users' credentials, history, and cookies in web browsers. The captured information can include saved credit card info, passwords for accounts to other sites, and more. This can then lead to further rippling effects, including disruption of business operations and financial loss.  Global Director, SpiderLabs Threat Hunt Team, Trustwave.  Expanded Facebook User Targeting SYS01 represents a new wave of infostealer malware with more sophisticated capabilities and evasion techniques, making it a formidable threat. Since its emergence in March 2023, SYS01 has dramatically evolved. Initially distributed through Facebook advertisements related to adult content and gaming, this new version which has been operating since September 2023, now includes ads for AI-tools and Windows themes. This evolution advances SYS01’s appearance of legitimacy and extends its reach to target the general population, making it more challenging for users to identify and avoid malicious ads. As this malware continues to evolve and target a larger pool of potential victims, organizations should implement filtering systems to analyze ad content for signs of malware or malicious intent to help mitigate risks. It's also crucial for employees to improve their own ability to recognize spoofed ads and maintain good cybersecurity hygiene by staying informed about the latest trends and tools used by cybercriminals. The Adaptive Nature of SYS01 SYS01 can manipulate antivirus software configurations to avoid detection and maintain presence on infected systems for extended periods. This makes it much more challenging for traditional security solutions to detect the malware. With the ability to identify virtualized environments used by security researchers for malware analysis, SYS01 can further alter its behavior or halt execution to prevent discovery by security tools.   Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!   Not only can SYS01 manipulate security tools to evade detection, but its adaptability also allows it to continue to morph and adjust to increase effectiveness with each malicious ad campaign. Leveraging calculated A/B testing, SYS01 adapts and refines its ads to maximize engagement and click-through rates and repeats use of the more successful advertisements. Given the adaptive nature of SYS01, organizations should ensure they have host-based anti-malware tools to help detect and protect against malicious exploits. Security and IT teams can go a step further by keeping browsers and plugins up-to-date and configuring browsers and tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies to reduce the risk of session cookie theft of sensitive information. When prevention isn’t possible, audit controls can also help detect potential compromises. One Infostealer After Another As cybercriminals continue to innovate with their use of infostealers, maintaining vigilance and implementing robust security measures is critical. SYS01 is just one of many infostealer threats. Many of its tactics exhibit striking similarities to other infostealers, such as Rilide. Disguising itself as a legitimate Google Drive extension, Rilide targets Chromium-based browsers – such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera – leveraging Google Ads to carry out attacks that monitor browsing history and capture screenshots before injecting malicious scripts to withdraw funds from cryptocurrency exchanges. To protect against such threats, security leaders should enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across their organizations. This adds an extra layer of defense, making unauthorized access more difficult if and when users inadvertently click on malicious ads. Proactive monitoring with tools like endpoint detection and response, alongside MFA, enhances security by detecting anomalies and aggregating data across an organization’s IT infrastructure. A Call for Proactive Defense SYS01’s evolution and sophisticated capabilities underscore the growing threat posed by infostealers, particularly in its demonstrated ability to evade detection and continuously evolve. This flexibility highlights the need for cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of the curve to effectively anticipate and mitigate future threats. By investing in robust defenses, monitoring solutions, and proactive threat hunting, organizations can better safeguard against the rising risks of infostealers and protect their digital assets from potential harm.

Our key findings include:\\n\\n*   92% of the IoCs continue to resolve to sites\\n*   1,700+ artifacts connected to the threat IoCs through WHOIS details and string usage\\n*   700+ connected properties that share the IoCs\\u2019 IP hosts\\n*   Some artifacts targeted banks, a decentralized financial (De-Fi) platform, and a courier\\n\\nA sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our [website](https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/threat-reports/redline-stealer-ioc-analysis-and-expansion?mc=circleid).\\n\\n#### RedLine Stealer IoC Analysis\\n\\nOur analysis covered 990 unique domains and IP addresses tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs by CloudSEK and ThreatFox. We looked into their string usage, WHOIS details, IP geolocation data, and resolutions. Below are the details of our findings.\\n\\n##### String Analysis of the IoCs\\n\\nSeveral domains tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs appeared to lure victims into downloading free or cracked versions of software. The word cloud below reflects that, with the most common strings used being \\u201cfree,\\u201d \\u201ccrack,\\u201d and \\u201csoftware.\\u201d\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852a.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852a.jpg)\\n\\nThe IoCs mostly fell under the .com and .org generic top-level domain (gTLD) spaces. We also saw some new gTLDs, such as .xyz, .tech, .top, .pro, and .space, as shown in the chart below. In some cases, the threat actors registered the second-level domains (SLDs) using different TLDs. For example, the domain string \\u201ccracksoftware\\u201d appeared with .site and .space extensions.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852b.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852b.jpg)\\n\\n##### WHOIS Characteristics of the IoCs\\n\\nWe ran the malicious domains on [Bulk WHOIS Lookup](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-api/?mc=circleid) to retrieve their complete WHOIS information. Most of them were registered with Namecheap and Reg.ru, with each accounting for 28% of the total registration.\\n\\nAlmost all of the domains were created between July and November 2022. We also identified the most-used name server reflected in the image below.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852c.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852c.jpg)\\n\\nAbout 31% of the IoCs were registered in Iceland and all had redacted WHOIS records protected by Withheld for Privacy EHF. Consistent with that, 84% of the domains had redacted WHOIS records. Still, we found five public registrant email addresses. We expanded these findings in later sections.\\n\\n##### IP Geolocation Analysis\\n\\nWe ran all the IoCs on [Bulk IP Geolocation](https://ip-geolocation.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-gui/?mc=circleid) to see how many still had IP resolutions and pinpoint their geolocations and administrators. About 92% of the RedLine Stealer IoCs currently resolved to IP addresses.\\n\\nAs shown in the chart below, most of the IP hosts were geolocated in the Netherlands, Russia, Germany, and the U.S.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852d.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852d.jpg)\\n\\nOn the other hand, the top ISPs included Hetzner Online GmbH and Partner LLC, Delis LLC, Amazon.com, Inc., and 106 others.

Here are a few examples.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852f.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852f.jpg)\\n\\n#### IoC Expansion: Uncovering Additional Suspicious Domains\\n\\n##### WHOIS-Connected Artifacts\\n\\nWe used the findings from our IoC analysis to uncover more domains possibly connected to RedLine Stealer. On [Reverse WHOIS](https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search?mc=circleid), we used some of the domains\\u2019 common WHOIS characteristics and text strings. These search strings were specifically used:\\n\\n*   **Registrar name:** _Starts with_ Namecheap\\n*   **Name server:** _Starts with_ DNS1.REGISTRAR-SERVERS.COM\\n*   **Creation date:** _From_ 1 July - 20 December 2022\\n\\nAside from these search parameters, we also specified the SLDs so the tool would only return those that contained specific string combinations. The table below shows the strings and examples of the connected domains we found. More domain samples can be found in the Appendix.\\n\\n\\u201cSoftware\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCrack\\u201d\\n\\nnostr\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\nrevosoftware\\\\[.\\\\]company  \\nreversed\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\ncarbonsparksoftware\\\\[.\\\\]blog  \\ncarbonsparksoftware\\\\[.\\\\]cloud\\n\\ncrackedbedwars\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\npccracked\\\\[.\\\\]org  \\nsoft-warecrack\\\\[.\\\\]store  \\ncrack-soft-ware\\\\[.\\\\]store  \\ncrackedprograms\\\\[.\\\\]co.uk\\n\\n\\u201cFree\\u201d + \\u201cWare\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSoftware\\u201d + \\u201cApp\\u201d\\n\\nfreesoftwaredownload\\\\[.\\\\]net  \\nfreewaregadgets\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nfreesoftwaresystem\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nfreesoftwareapk\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\ndesignsoftwarefree\\\\[.\\\\]com\\n\\ncodeapp\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\napplicationsoftwaredevelopment\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nvpmapping\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\nbootstrappedsoftware\\\\[.\\\\]partners  \\nsoftwareapp\\\\[.\\\\]online\\n\\nWe found 1,756 domains potentially connected to RedLine Stealer based on similar WHOIS details and string usage. While some may be legitimate software businesses, many hosted adult content and other suspicious pages.\\n\\nSome examples include freesoftwareapk\\\\[.\\\\]com, which offers free software and features download buttons for each product, and softwareaktualisierung\\\\[.\\\\]live, which offers support services for Microsoft users. However, its WHOIS details can\\u2019t be attributed to the imitated organization.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852g.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852g.jpg)\\n\\n##### IP-Connected Artifacts\\n\\nAnother reliable way to find more properties connected to the threat is to look at shared IP hosts. To do that, we used [Reverse IP/DNS API](https://dns-history.whoisxmlapi.com/?mc=circleid) and found that 98% of the IP addresses tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs had 50 or fewer resolving domains. That may indicate they were dedicated IP addresses.\\n\\nWe found 750 IP-connected artifacts, some of which have already figured in malicious campaigns, including cybersquatting domains targeting Canada Post, Santander Bank, Scotia Bank, and Uniswap. Alarmingly, the Uniswap-related malicious domains continued to host content as shown below.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852h.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852h.jpg)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThreat analysis is critical to understanding malicious actors\\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). A more targeted IoC analysis can lead to suspicious and possibly dormant weapons.\\n\\nBy shedding light on the DNS footprints of public RedLine Stealer IoCs, we uncovered a total of 2,506 possible threat artifacts. Our analysis of the related properties shows that some have already figured in malicious campaigns, while others were suspicious.\\n\\n**_If you wish to perform a similar investigation or get access to the full data behind this research, please don\\u2019t hesitate to [contact us](https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/security-research-partnerships?action=show&subject=modal&id=contactUsModal&mc=threatreport)._**\"}, {\"title\": \"What is InfoStealer Malware and How Does It Work?\", \"link\": \"https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-is-infostealer-malware-and-how-does-it-work/\", \"snippet\": \"<strong>InfoStealer</strong> malware plays a key role in many cyber attacks, enabling extortion and lateral movement via stolen credentials.

[The Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), developed by Lockheed Martin, details the sequential phases of a cyber attack: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. Attacker tactics and techniques can be mapped using models such as the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.\\n\\nFollowing these known strategies, after gaining unauthorized initial access, the installation phase allows the attacker to establish a foothold, and through command and control (C2), they maintain ongoing access to the compromised environment.\\n\\nDuring these middle stages InfoStealer malware often comes into play. InfoStealer malware is a type of malicious software specifically designed to extract sensitive information from an infected system. The stolen information can be leveraged to extort victims, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid, or sold on the blackmarket to other organized criminal organizations.\\u00a0 Furthermore, if the stolen information contains the victim's credentials such as username, passwords, or private keys, the attacker can use them to compromise other systems, furthering their attack.\\n\\nIn this article we will provide a comprehensive review of InfoStealer malware, what information it targets, how it operates, and list the most prolific InfoStealer malware strains. By understanding the role of InfoStealer malware organizations can better prepare and respond to the intricate landscape of cyber threats they face today.\\n\\nWhat is InfoStealer Malware?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware, as its name suggests, is a type of malicious software designed specifically to gather sensitive information from infected systems. This category of malware targets personal, financial, and business data, which can include passwords, [credit card numbers](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/pci-penetration-test/), browsing history, and other valuable information. The ultimate goal of InfoStealers is to transmit this stolen data to cybercriminals who can use it for financial gain, identity theft, or further malicious activities.\\n\\nInfoStealers often enter systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or [compromised websites](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/heres-how-you-can-defend-against-drive-by-compromise-attacks/). Once installed, they can operate quietly in the background, making them particularly hard to detect. They may also employ various techniques to avoid detection, maintain persistence, find other valuable targets on a network, and allow attackers to issue commands remotely. The most sophisticated InfoStealers are modular; they can import specific payloads after scanning the environment for potential sources of valuable information.\\n\\nHow Do InfoStealers Work?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware employs a variety of techniques to target and extract specific types of data from infected systems. Each strain of malware that is classified as a InfoStealer has different capabilities ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated modular malware. It's also important to remember that data can be stolen from a system using native built-in OS tooling known as a [Living Off The Land (LOTL)](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-living-off-the-land-attacks/) attack.\\n\\nEach method discussed below targets specific types of data or input-output peripherals. Each method also leverages unique vulnerabilities associated with how that data is used, stored, and transmitted. The diversity of these techniques underscores the necessity for comprehensive security measures that protect not just against one type of threat but a broad array of infiltration strategies.\\n\\nHere are some ways that InfoStealer malware operates:\\n\\n*   **Keylogging**: One of the most common tactics, keylogging involves recording keystrokes made by a user. By capturing everything typed, attackers can later filter out passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive personal information\\n    \\n*   **Form Grabbing**: This technique is used to intercept data submitted in forms on web pages before it is encrypted by the browser. It's particularly effective for stealing login credentials, payment information, and other data entered on websites\\n    \\n*   **Clipboard Hijacking**: InfoStealers can monitor and modify the clipboard content on an infected device. When a user copies data such as account numbers or passwords, the malware replaces or steals this information. This attack technique can even steal usernames and passwords as they are auto-filled by a [password manager](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/password-manager-breach/)\\n    \\n*   **Screen Capturing**: By taking screenshots of the user\\u2019s screen at critical moments\\u2014such as while entering credentials or viewing personal information\\u2014this method can bypass text-based data extraction limitations, capturing data displayed on the screen in any form\\n    \\n*   **Browser Session Hijacking**: This method involves stealing cookies and session tokens from a browser's cached memory which can allow cybercriminals to impersonate the victim's online session, gaining unauthorized access to online accounts without needing a username and password\\n    \\n*   **Credential Dumping**: This method extracts data from user accounts stored on the system, such as login credentials saved in web browsers or other client software. If they are stored in encrypted format, attackers will attempt to crack them offline using specialized hardware and software tools\\n    \\n*   **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: These are more sophisticated attacks where the malware injects malicious code [into the web browser itself](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/how-safe-are-your-browsers/). This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate information in real-time as it is entered on secure websites\\n    \\n*   **Email Harvesting**: The malware searches through files and emails stored on the computer to collect email addresses and other contact information, which can be used for spamming or further phishing attacks\\n    \\n*   **Crypto-Wallet Harvesting:** Some InfoStealer malware can search known installation paths for common crypto-wallet software and attempt to steal private keys. Once in the attacker's possession these keys can be used to transfer the victim's cryptocurrency to attacker controlled accounts\\n    \\n\\nThe Most Prolific Strains of InfoStealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstimating the exact number of InfoStealer malware strains is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of malware and the frequent emergence of new variants. However, cybersecurity experts and researchers generally agree that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different strains of InfoStealer malware in existence. This vast range includes everything from well-documented and widely recognized strains to more obscure or specialized ones that target specific geographic regions or sectors.\\n\\n*   [**Zeus (Zbot)**](https://www.cynet.com/malware/zeus-malware-variants-methods-and-history/)**:** Perhaps the most infamous InfoStealer, Zeus primarily targets financial information. First identified in 2007, it has been responsible for numerous cybercrimes, including banking fraud and the formation of botnets. Zeus is known for its ability to elude detection by using stealth techniques and its capability to replicate and distribute itself\\n    \\n*   [**Ursnif (Gozi)**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0386/)**:** Ursnif is another banking Trojan that has been active for over a decade. Ursnif is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, modular design, and its ability to steal a wide variety of data types, including banking credentials and personal identifiable information (PII). Ursnif is typically spread through exploit kits and phishing emails\\n    \\n*   [**Agent Tesla**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331/)**:** Agent Tesla is a sophisticated spyware that functions primarily as a keylogger and a remote access trojan (RAT). First identified around 2014, it is capable of monitoring and collecting the victim's keyboard inputs, system clipboard, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating credentials from a variety of software installed on the victim\\u2019s machine. Agent Tesla is often distributed via malicious email attachments, disguised as legitimate files or links that execute the malware upon opening\\n    \\n*   [**LokiBot**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0447/)**:** LokiBot, first detected in 2015, is an information stealer that targets multiple platforms to steal a variety of credentials such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data. It also has modular functionalities to download and execute additional malicious payloads giving the attacker remote access.

Ducktail malware is typically delivered through a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. Once the malware infects a system, it establishes a persistent presence and begins to gather information about the system and the network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis info-stealer is being disseminated through Facebook URLs, employing a technique that redirects users to suspicious websites or pages. Once redirected, users are prompted to manually click on a download button, which initiates the download of malicious files onto their devices. This method of distribution capitalizes on user interaction and engagement to deceive them into downloading the malware. The malicious files obtained through this process pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of the affected users, potentially leading to various harmful consequences such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, system compromise, or further malware infections.\\n\\n![Image 33](https://cdn-igifd.nitrocdn.com/LjFqjuxPeeUzGqzhGkddQHQrbKmisRar/assets/images/optimized/rev-c5d0e80/www.rewterz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/an-emerging-ducktail-infostealer.png)\\n\\nThe research team has been analyzing a series of info-stealing malware, and they have recently come across an interesting campaign involving the PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer. This malware is being actively distributed by disguising itself as a free or cracked application installer for popular software, including games, Microsoft Office applications, and Telegram. Ducktail Infostealer, attributed to a Vietnamese threat group, has been active since 2021 and has primarily targeted Facebook Business accounts to manipulate pages and gain access to financial information.\\n\\nThe Ducktail Infostealer instances were first identified in late 2021. In July 2022, researchers observed that the threat actors were specifically targeting higher-level employees with access to Facebook Business accounts to steal data and take control of the accounts. The earlier versions of Ducktail were based on a binary written in .NET Core and utilized Telegram as its command and control (C2) channel for exfiltrating data. However, in August 2022, a new campaign was observed involving a PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer with new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\\n\\nAccording to an analysis, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting specific employees with administrative or financial access to Facebook Business accounts to a broader audience. The malicious executable files are typically in .ZIP format and are hosted on file-sharing platforms, posing as cracked or free versions of popular applications like Office, games, subtitles, and explicit content files. Compared to previous campaigns, changes have been made in the execution of the malicious code. The threat actors now employ a scripting version where the main stealer code is a PHP script instead of a .NET binary.\\n\\nThe execution flow begins with a fake installer that generates a temporary file, which then re-initiates the installer with a \\\"/Silent\\\" parameter. Another temporary file is created, which drops all the supporting files and malicious files at a specific location on the victim's machine. To achieve persistence, a series of events take place, scheduling tasks to execute the malicious payload, named \\\"libbridged.exe,\\\" daily and at regular intervals.\\n\\nThe stealing of data and its exfiltration are achieved by decrypting the stealer code at runtime in memory. The PHP script performs various actions, such as fetching browser information, extracting stored browser cookies, targeting Facebook Business accounts, searching for cryptocurrency account information in the wallet.dat file, and sending the collected data to the command and control (C&C) server.\\n\\nThe PHP script creates PHP associative arrays to prepare for data transmission to the C&C server. The CURL command is used for sending and receiving files over HTTP, and specific switches are employed during communication.\\n\\nThe script also collects information about installed browsers, retrieves data from the local state file in the Chrome user data directory, decodes sensitive data protected by Chrome's local data encryption, encodes stolen information to base64, and saves it to log files. It specifically targets Facebook pages, including Facebook API graph, Facebook Ads Manager, and Facebook Business accounts, to gather account details, payment cycles, account statuses, funding sources, and other relevant information.\\n\\nAfter completing the data-stealing activities, the PHP script connects to the C&C server to obtain a list of targeted folders and URLs stored in JSON format, which are then used to gather further information. The stolen data is sent to the C&C server in JSON format.\\n\\nTo conclude, the threat actors behind the Ducktail Infostealer campaign are continuously evolving their delivery mechanisms and tactics to steal a wide range of sensitive user and system information, particularly targeting Facebook Business accounts.\\n\\nImpact\\n------\\n\\n*   Sensitive Information Theft\\n*   Credential Theft\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise\\n------------------------\\n\\n#### Domain Name\\n\\n*   bwtraining.nl\\n*   dj-w.nl\\n*   ductri.shop\\n*   evdgoudsmid.nl\\n*   fsh-kpn.nl\\n*   funatfunction.nl\\n*   hakotrailers.nl\\n*   laterremadit.fr\\n*   lwdzuid.nl\\n*   nano-phone.fr\\n*   sgf-advies.nl\\n*   singano.shop\\n*   thediverse.se\\n*   zaoui.nl\\n*   dfgdfgfdgdfgdfg.shop\\n*   dausoviettelpro.online\\n*   insiktnordahl.se\\n\\n#### MD5\\n\\n*   de8d2f3a429b72be0b3fa968e89554c1\\n*   aa424dafb152c8696d472c001463b498\\n*   42df34c8cddcb2ebf793869d4220cc2b\\n*   b5fb2e07d7f0353c9648976d0cd2d9de\\n*   0f548b327788e6352eb262a138c1f87b\\n*   019c5102755e3f50e4d44ca82c9626ef\\n*   c1d0c76c34e1eb3588b05547dede3529\\n*   30e9e32a73933af3083b584af7858a3a\\n*   5cfc95d5f595963bb00c3d6ad96949e9\\n*   424ea05ac23ba6a504c1b193b6c5bcaf\\n*   512be004172b5715d881e0551d99590a\\n*   cff1b30dabdb292a22fa38c65df0bd40\\n*   5ec0d1215f205e9b4e8cd8d8f4095987\\n*   0f47b858719fbd7def7fd7f42b228cc0\\n*   d0b361bab520a5c1ee7c33aa1321100f\\n\\n#### SHA-256\\n\\n*   90523861a28cf8a33cfb2681fcbf029a16d353aea24d7fc47850af420e68835c\\n*   26dcfbc7cb948a84d5a24df6ebe9641a2a6201512aef5def698418a8e25e1fb0\\n*   c84c2d3be279f5eea89b6a40989a7511896c826b62341707971370f817e9b1c9\\n*   1b7d6e68479b6779b3992775faad0224beb3cc572c974b48ab184fec96012693\\n*   2187eab7da2eda3425f76ef8a051d83706304da3457a0188573a0a8d67fbc82b\\n*   5c7296ee878788c0fed596cac75498f11e218fa783fd1f4c92df8994f52049cc\\n*   73d7739688d8ae59c95cb14ea212ab5eedcd10e22cbed323cfbb072de139bc42\\n*   bab2ce1025546d4f5e988c85328d22ed7182dec9e741bcf2010ae0ff7ac5a031\\n*   8b9706472cbac5ddc24bd904b796d2fca6ba0729278ea6a1304815828db57da7\\n*   217bb8f973660942a6272a38702579f32e92f9f14b1f3287900fadb1dd28a542\\n*   0cebcb2df28653ec969bb2961abc2b74e666829f620a53705dcfad8d2c6362b6\\n*   10f158890c91e819b5a80ac17ae3bb96e98fe3a0c2dd97efac0c92b70ac00604\\n*   4c7b635e100b52c3a1ae92630b1933ab51baea8dea2646015b52ac4495887ce4\\n*   4ea385d2ecf3b53ad909c69a05e2906ca5e91be55eb5e12286fa516b516b8889\\n*   663221ff71dc932f91d4a9f6ecbb77cd1afc8d93f77a1e7e4f7d1fc3280dee93\\n\\n#### SHA-1\\n\\n*   86285bb8af48913b041374df15cceeaabb853498\\n*   8e1d5da5924df66077495191c8d5a3b6e1252eb3\\n*   a564a1d75214f10d1d9ef9cab0eb32d7db3008c0\\n*   29d40663e3222ef728cca4d838729325a5a81d5a\\n*   fbd3fecf461ec1de949bdd81a7695e1a11fa37e6\\n*   446e4a72f692bd48407ca073957df7dbbc86764c\\n*   66d7224339e16c08947e8ff7f8ea98b0197977a5\\n*   5d4d4ebcd6a6c7a3194fdd1d7f12ea1fa659bbb8\\n*   7372273c7f1d0417eb3c003395e7f6ddad8c39b0\\n*   5ca4cc70b71208bc3edef432edd01540874054e7\\n*   faaf431589e8121b2af3fa6b8fcffb2286055c9a\\n*   7e20c34516060af5468959edf848e26c1e1747bc\\n*   fa13cfffbfe4303114daa91686a08cb37c908157\\n*   51ea1ac2f86993ebd8b11df5417feaca8a42f55d\\n*   622b8eef1a0491d8e2f57d0c24c9fdd003510c60\\n\\nRemediation\\n-----------\\n\\n*   Block all threat indicators at your respective controls. Search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in your environment utilizing your respective security controls.\\n*   Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts adds an extra layer of security and can help prevent unauthorized access even if your login credentials have been stolen.\\n*   Regularly backing up your important data can help ensure you don't lose any critical information in the event of a malware infection or other data loss event.\\n*   Be wary of emails, attachments, and links from unknown sources. Also, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources or clicking on suspicious ads or pop-ups.\\n*   Make sure all of your software, including your operating system and applications, is up-to-date with the latest security patches. This can help prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by info-stealers and other types of malware.\\n*   Promptly apply security patches and updates for operating systems, software applications, and browsers. This helps to address vulnerabilities that threat actors may exploit to deliver malware.\\n*   Utilize web filtering solutions and URL reputation services to block access to known malicious websites and prevent users from visiting potentially dangerous links, such as those used in Ducktail infostealer campaigns.\\n*   Implement network segmentation to restrict access and isolate critical systems, such as those hosting sensitive financial information or Facebook Business accounts. This prevents lateral movement of malware and limits the impact of a potential compromise.\\n*   Implement robust monitoring solutions to detect any unusual or suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration. Establish an effective incident response plan to quickly respond to and mitigate any potential breaches.\\n*   Maintain regular backups of critical data, including Facebook Business account information, and ensure they are stored securely offline. This enables quick recovery in case of a successful attack or data loss.\\n\\n \\n\\n#### Platform\\n\\n*   [Rewterz XDR](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-xdr)\\n*   [Rewterz Defense](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-defense)\\n*   [Rewterz Threat Intelligence](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-threat-intelligence)\\n\\n#### Managed Security Services\\n\\n*   [Managed Security Monitoring](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring)\\n*   [Remote SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n*   [Onsite SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n*   [Hybrid SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n\\n#### Assess\\n\\n*   [Compromise Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/compromise-assessment)\\n*   [APT Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/advanced-persistent-threats-assessment)\\n*   [Penetration Testing](https://www.rewterz.com/services/penetration-testing)\\n*   [Architecture Design & Review](https://www.rewterz.com/services/secure-architecture-design-review)\\n*   [Red Team Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/red-team-assessment)\\n*   [Purple Team Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/purple-team-assessment)\\n*   [Social Engineering](https://www.rewterz.com/services/social-engineering)\\n*   [Source Code Review](https://www.rewterz.com/services/source-code-review)\\n\\n#### Transform\\n\\n*   [SOC Consultancy](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy)\\n*   [SOC Maturity Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-maturity-assessment)\\n*   [SOC Model Evaluation](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-model-evaluation)\\n*   [SOC Gap Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-gap-analysis)\\n*   [SIEM Gap Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/siem-gap-analysis)\\n*   [SIEM Optimization](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/siem-optimization)\\n*   [SOC Content Pack](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-content-pack)\\n\\n#### Train\\n\\n*   [Simulated Cyber Attack Exercise](https://www.rewterz.com/services/simulated-cyber-attack-exercise)\\n*   [Tabletop Exercise](https://www.rewterz.com/services/tabletop-exercise)\\n*   [Security Awareness and Training](https://www.rewterz.com/services/security-awareness-and-training)\\n\\n#### Respond\\n\\n*   [Incident Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/incident-analysis)\\n*   [Incident Response](https://www.rewterz.com/services/incident-response)\\n\\n#### Threat Insights\\n\\n*   [Threat Advisories](https://www.rewterz.com/threat-advisory)\\n*   [Monthly Threat Insights](https://www.rewterz.com/monthly-threat-insights)\\n*   [Threat Intelligence Reports](https://www.rewterz.com/threat-intelligence-reports)\\n\\n#### Resources\\n\\n*   [Blog](https://www.rewterz.com/blog)\\n*   [Press Releases](https://www.rewterz.com/press-releases)\\n*   [Events](https://www.rewterz.com/event-page)\\n\\n#### Connect With Us\\n\\n*   [Contact](https://www.rewterz.com/contact)\\n*   [Careers](https://www.rewterz.com/careers)\\n\\n![Image 34](blob:https://www.rewterz.com/242b3fe432c022466a1d4043b71af5f1)\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT \\u00a9 REWTERZ.

The stolen information is then packaged, sent to the attacker, and often traded on illicit markets to other [cybercriminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_criminals \\\"Cyber criminals\\\").\\n\\nInfostealers usually consist of two parts: the bot framework that allows the attacker to configure the behaviour of the infostealer on the victim's computer, and a management panel that takes the form of a server to which the infostealer sends data. Infostealers infiltrate devices through [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing \\\"Phishing\\\") attacks, infected websites, and malicious software downloads including [video game mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_mods \\\"Video game mods\\\") and [pirated software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_software \\\"Pirated software\\\"), among other methods. Once downloaded, the infostealers gather sensitive information about the user's device and send the data back to the server.\\n\\nInfostealers are usually distributed under the malware-[as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service \\\"As a service\\\") (MaaS) model, where [developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer \\\"Programmer\\\") allow other parties to use their infostealers for subscription fees. This allows people with different levels of technical knowledge to deploy an infostealer. The functionality of infostealers can vary, with some focused on [data harvesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_harvesting \\\"Data harvesting\\\"), while others offer [remote access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan \\\"Remote access trojan\\\") that allows additional malware to be executed. [Stolen data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach \\\"Data breach\\\") may then be used in [spearphishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearphishing \\\"Spearphishing\\\") campaigns for other cyber-attacks, such as the deployment of [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\").\\n\\nThe proliferation of infostealer-as-a-service providers has contributed to an increase in the number of [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \\\"Computer security\\\") incidents involving infostealers. The number of stolen [data logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing) \\\"Logging (computing)\\\") being sold on the Russian Market, a [cybercrime forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_forum \\\"Crime forum\\\"), has increased significantly since 2022. According to [Kaspersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab \\\"Kaspersky Lab\\\")'s research in mid-2023, 24% of malware offered as a service are infostealers.\\n\\nIn [cybercrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime \\\"Cybercrime\\\"), credential theft is a well-known mechanism through which malicious individuals steal [personal information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data \\\"Personal data\\\") such as [usernames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usernames \\\"Usernames\\\"), [passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password \\\"Password\\\"), or [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie \\\"HTTP cookie\\\") to illegitimately gain access to a victim's online accounts and computer. This crime typically unfolds in four stages, with the first being the acquisition of the stolen credentials. Infostealers are a specific type of [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware \\\"Malware\\\"), that are designed for this initial stage. They usually consist of two distinct parts: the bot framework and a [command and control server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_server \\\"Command and control server\\\"), often known as the management panel or interface.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)\\n\\nThe bot framework includes a builder that allows the attacker to configure how the infostealer will behave on a user's computer and what kind of information it will steal. The management interface, usually written in traditional [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development \\\"Web development\\\") languages like [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP \\\"PHP\\\"), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML \\\"HTML\\\"), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript \\\"JavaScript\\\")[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2) is typically hosted on the commercial [cloud infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_infrastructure \\\"Cloud infrastructure\\\").[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-3) The management interface primarily functions as a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server \\\"Web server\\\") to which the infostealer send confidential information. The interface also provides the attacker with information about the status of the deployed infostealers and allows the attacker to control the behavior of the infostealers.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)\\n\\nDistribution and use\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infostealer&action=edit&section=2 \\\"Edit section: Distribution and use\\\")\\\\]\\n\\nInfostealers are commonly distributed through the malware-[as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service \\\"As a service\\\") (MaaS) model, enabling individuals with varying technical knowledge to deploy these malicious programs. Under this model, three distinct groups typically emerge: developers, malware service providers, and operators. Developers, the most technically skilled, write the infostealer code. Malware service providers purchase licenses for the malware and offer it as a service to other cybercriminals. The operators, who can be developers or service providers themselves depending on their skill level, use these services to perform [credential theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft \\\"Identity theft\\\").[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)\\n\\nOnce the malware is purchased, it is spread to target victim machines using various [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) \\\"Social engineering (security)\\\") techniques. [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing \\\"Phishing\\\"), including [spear phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_phishing \\\"Spear phishing\\\") campaigns that target specific victims, are commonly employed. Infostealers are commonly embedded in [email attachments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_attachment \\\"Email attachment\\\") or malicious links that link to websites performing drive-by downloads.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance1-4) Additionally, they are often bundled with compromised or malicious [browser extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension \\\"Browser extension\\\"), infected [game mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mods \\\"Game mods\\\"), and pirated or otherwise compromised software.[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance1-4) After the stealer is downloaded and run by a victim, it communicates with the attacker's [command and control servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-and-control_server \\\"Command-and-control server\\\"), allowing the attacker to steal information from the user's computer. While most infostealers primarily target credentials, some also enable attackers to remotely introduce and execute other malware, such as [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\"), on the victim's computer.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-ryan-5)\\n\\nCredentials obtained from infostealer attacks are often distributed as logs or credential dumps, typically shared on paste sites like [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin \\\"Pastebin\\\"), where cybercriminals may offer free samples, or sold in bulk on underground hacking forums often for amounts as low as $10.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6)[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance2-7) Buyers of these stolen credentials usually log in to assess their value, particularly looking for credentials associated with financial services or linked to other credentials with similar patterns, as these are especially valuable.[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance6-8) High-value credentials are often sold to other cybercriminals at higher prices,[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance7-9) who may then use them for various crimes, including [financial fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_fraud \\\"Financial fraud\\\"),[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance8-10) integrating the credentials into [zombie networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_network \\\"Zombie network\\\") and reputation boosting operations[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance8-10) or as springboards for more sophisticated attacks such as scamming businesses, distributing ransomware, or conducting state-sponsored espionage.[\\\\[11\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-11)[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) Additionally, some cybercriminals use stolen credentials for [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) \\\"Social engineering (security)\\\") attacks, impersonating the original owner to claim they have been a victim of a crime and soliciting money from the victim\\u2019s contacts.[\\\\[12\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-what_happen-12)[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-imc353-13) Many buyers of these stolen credentials take precautions to maintain access for longer periods, such as changing passwords, using [Tor networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network) \\\"Tor (network)\\\") to obscure their locations, which helps avoid detection by services that might otherwise identify and shut down the stolen credentials.[\\\\[12\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-what_happen-12)[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-imc353-13)\\n\\nAn infostealers primary function is to exfiltrate sensitive information about the victim to an attacker's [command and control servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-and-control_server \\\"Command-and-control server\\\"). The exact type of data that is exfiltrated will depend on the data-stealing features enabled by the operator and the specific variant of infostealer used.[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-14) Most infostealers however, do contain functionality to harvest a variety of information about the host operating system, and system settings and user profiles. Some more advanced infostealers include the capability to introduce secondary malware like [remote access trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Access_Trojans_(RATs) \\\"Remote Access Trojans (RATs)\\\") and [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\").[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)\\n\\nIn 2009, researchers at the [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital \\\"Gen Digital\\\") Rapid Response team released a technical analysis of the [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(malware) \\\"Zeus (malware)\\\") infostealer, one of the first infostealers to be created.[\\\\[15\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-15) They found that the malware automatically exfiltrated all data stored in a computer's protected storage service (which was usually used by [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer \\\"Internet Explorer\\\") to store passwords) and tries to capture any passwords sent to the computer using the [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3 \\\"POP3\\\") and [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol \\\"File Transfer Protocol\\\") protocol. In addition to this, the malware allowed the researchers to define a set of configuration files to specify a list of web injections to perform on a user's computer as well as another configuration file that controlled which web [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL \\\"URL\\\") the malware would monitor. Another configuration also allowed the researchers to define a set of rules that could be used to test if additional [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP \\\"HTTP\\\") requests contained passwords or other sensitive information.[\\\\[16\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-symantec-16)\\n\\nMore recently, in 2020, researchers at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven_University_of_Technology \\\"Eindhoven University of Technology\\\") conducted a study analyzing the information available for sale on the underground credential [black-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market \\\"Black market\\\") impaas.ru. As part of their study, they were able to replicate the workings of a version of the [AZORult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZORult \\\"AZORult\\\") infostealer. Amongst the functions discovered by the researchers was a builder which allowed operators to define what kind of data would be stolen. The researchers also found evidence of plugins that stole a user's [browsing history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsing_history \\\"Web browsing history\\\"), a customizable [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression \\\"Regular expression\\\") based mechanism that allows the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from a user's computer, a browser password extractor module, a module to extract [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype \\\"Skype\\\") history and a module to find and exfiltrate [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency \\\"Cryptocurrency\\\") wallet files.[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-14)\\n\\nThe researchers also found that the data most frequently stolen using the AZORult infostealers and sold on the black market could be broadly categorized into three main types: fingerprints, cookies, and resources. [Fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint \\\"Device fingerprint\\\") consisted of identifiers that were constructed by probing a variety of features made available by the browser. These were not tied to a specific service but were considered to be an accurately unique identifier for a user's browsers. [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie \\\"HTTP cookie\\\") allowed buyers to [hijack a victim's browser session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking \\\"Session hijacking\\\") by injecting it into a browser environment. Resources refer to browser-related files found on a user's operating system, such as password storage files.[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-70-17)\\n\\nEconomics and impact\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infostealer&action=edit&section=4 \\\"Edit section: Economics and impact\\\")\\\\]\\n\\nSetting up an infostealer operation has become increasingly accessible due to the proliferation of stealer-as-a-service enterprises, significantly lowering financial and technical barriers. This makes it feasible for even less sophisticated cybercriminals to engage in such activities.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2) In a 2023 paper, researchers from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech \\\"Georgia Tech\\\") noted that the hosted stealer market is extremely mature and highly competitive, with some operators offering to set up infostealers for as low as $12.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5309-18) For the service providers running these stealer operations, the researchers estimated that a typical infostealer operator incurs only a few one-off costs: the license to use the infostealer which is obtained from a malware developer, and the registration fee for the domain used to host the [command and control server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_server \\\"Command and control server\\\"). The primary ongoing cost incurred by these operators is the cost associated with hosting the servers. Based on these calculations, the researchers concluded that the stealer-as-a-service business model is extremely profitable, with many operators achieving profit margins of over 90% with revenues in the high thousands.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5318-19)\\n\\nDue to their extreme profitability and accessibility, the number of cybersecurity incidents that involve infostealers has risen.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) The [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 \\\"COVID-19\\\") post-pandemic shift towards [remote and hybrid work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work \\\"Remote work\\\"), where companies give employees access to enterprise services on their home machines has also been cited as one of the reasons behind the increase in the effectiveness of infostealers.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-scmedia-20)[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) In 2023, research by [Secureworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secureworks \\\"Secureworks\\\") discovered that the number of infostealer logs\\u2014data exfiltrated from each computer\\u2014being sold on the Russian Market, the biggest underground market increased from 2 million to 5\\u00a0 million logs from June 2022 to February 2023.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-scmedia-20) According to [Kaspersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab \\\"Kaspersky Lab\\\")'s research in mid-2023, 24% of malware offered as a service are infostealers.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-register-21)\\n\\n1.  ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_ref-usenix5308_1-0)

It was known to target credentials of online banking services. The code of ZeuS was leaked and then many variants of it were created.\\n\\nInfostealer malware is designed to steal data after a single run, and it usually removes itself from the system. These typically operate as malware as a service (MaaS), a business model in which the developers of malicious software lease their malware to others for a fee. This arrangement allows almost anyone to deploy an infostealer regardless of their technical know-how.\\n\\n**What information is collected by infostealers?**\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTypical information stolen by this type of malware include:\\n\\n*   Computer information such as hostname, username, IP address and OS details.\\n*   Data from browsers such as credentials, credit card numbers, cookies and autofill forms.\\n*   Other types of information such as cryptocurrency wallets, VPN clients\\u2019 data, other applications\\u2019 credentials (i.e., Steam, Discord, etc.) and any plain-text passwords stored on the system.\\n\\n  \\n**Why are they so dangerous?**\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware is known to steal not only saved credentials but also session tokens, which can help threat actors to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA). As a result, infostealers can provide threat actors with immediate account access without requiring the use of more sophisticated tools or staying active in an environment for long time.\\n\\nConfidential data stolen by infostealers is later offered through the darknet or other cybercriminal forums. Once bought, this information can fuel further malicious activities. The nature of activities performed by threat actors varies according to the value of the stolen information.\\n\\nWhile compromised credit cards or bank accounts might have individual consequences such as fraudulent transactions, etc., it\\u2019s not uncommon for users to save credentials to corporate browsers. From an attacker\\u2019s perspective, this type of data is low-hanging fruit that can allow quick access to corporate networks \\u2014 which could lead to serious consequences such as ransomware infection.\\n\\n  \\n**How does a system get infected with an infostealer?**\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe most common methods used by infostealers are:\\n\\n*   Phishing email: Threat actors commonly deliver infostealers via email. This can be through an attachment or tricking users into clicking on a URL within the email.\\n*   Search engine ads: Currently, the most frequent and effective distribution method of infostealer malware is through search engine ads. Threat actors masquerade phishing sites to mimic legitimate websites. Using Google or Bing ad features, attackers position such malicious sites to appear first in the search-engine results for a particular software.\\n*   Cracked/pirated software: Often, users are seen trying to download cracked software and compromising their system with infostealers.\\n*   Infected pen drives: Systems get infected with infostealer or other malware that copies itself to external drives such USB or pen drives. Then, when the drive connects to another system, that system gets infected as well. The technique is usually seen in .LNK malware that tricks users into clicking a file that looks like shortcut to the pen drive itself. However, clicking on the file initiates a connection to a command-and-control server from which the payload is downloaded.\\n*   YouTube videos: YouTube users are offered free game cheats within the videos. Clicking the link in the description box instead downloads an infostealer.\\n\\n  \\n**Case study**\\n-----------------\\n\\nA recent breach investigated by Atos Computer Security Incident Response Team about ransomware infection in one of the customer environment revealed the following course of action.\\n\\nA user, working from a corporate device, used their personal Google Account\\u2019s password synchronization feature to save their corporate VPN credentials in the browser. The same Google account was used on his private device as well, which meant the VPN credentials were synced to this device.\\n\\nThe user downloaded cracked software to their personal device. The infostealer malware infected the personal device, and threat actors were able to obtain the VPN credentials along with other stored credentials. This account was then used by threat actors to access the corporate environment. After data exfiltration, ransomware was deployed across other devices in the corporate environment. This also highlighted the requirement of MFA which was found to be missing in this case.\\n\\n  \\n**Infostealer trends**\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe below chart shows top user accounts compromised by infostealers. Note: Most targeted user accounts are Microsoft or Google accounts, which are also in many cases used by corporations. It also shows other social accounts.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://atos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIGURE-1-TOP-COMPROMISED-USERS.png)  \\n_Source \\u2013 Hudson Rock_\\n\\nThe graph below shows top infostealers seen in worldwide attacks.

So user training is very important, specifically on spotting fake/spoofed email. Users should stay vigilant when opening any email from unknown senders and report any suspicious emails to your security operations center for analysis.\\n\\n*   Scan/limit email attachments: Scan email attachments at the gateway level to check for malicious content. Block known malicious file extensions at the gateway level.\\n\\n*   Use MFA for all applications: MFA acts as an additional layer to protect users even if the user account gets compromised.\\n\\n*   Use password manager for storing and generating complex passwords, and do not store passwords in browsers.\\n\\n*   Deploy an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution on all endpoints: This way, even if a user opens a malicious attachment or clicks on a malicious URL, EDR will be able to detect, alert and block the threat.\\n\\n*   Block search-engine ads: Block search-engine ads at the proxy or web gateway level, or use ad-blockers to prevent malicious ads.\\n\\n*   Limit admin rights: Do not give admin rights to users. Whenever there is need of such rights, temporary permission can be assigned dynamically.\\n\\n*   Block unwanted applications through Microsoft Intune: Intune policies such as Windows Defender Application Control management prevent users from installing pirated/cracked software.\\n\\n*   Do not synchronize credentials between corporate and private devices: For example, don\\u2019t use private Google account sync features.\\n\\n*   As Defense strategy monitor what is available on the Dark Web within DRPS (Digital Risk Protection Services) which includes continuous monitoring of compromised credentials with technology like\\u00a0[Hudson Rock Cavalier.](https://www.hudsonrock.com/cavalier)\\n\\n[Hudson Rock](https://www.hudsonrock.com/)\\u00a0is an Israel company, which is utilizing cybercrime intelligence and forensic technologies that helps prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches caused by infostealer infections.

The malware can steal information from infected devices, including autocomplete and saved information on browsers, along with the system\\u2019s location, hardware configuration, and security software data.\\n\\nRedLine Stealer\\u2019s accessibility and scope of data theft are a deadly combination, prompting the cybersecurity community to conduct in-depth research on the malware such as CloudSEK\\u2019s [technical analysis](https://www.cloudsek.com/technical-analysis-of-the-redline-stealer/).\\n\\nBuilding on CloudSEK\\u2019s research and other sources of published indicators of compromise (IoCs), WhoisXML API researchers dove into RedLine Stealer\\u2019s DNS footprints. Our key findings include:\\n\\n*   92% of the IoCs continue to resolve to sites\\n*   1,700+ artifacts connected to the threat IoCs through WHOIS details and string usage\\n*   700+ connected properties that share the IoCs\\u2019 IP hosts\\n*   Some artifacts targeted banks, a decentralized financial (De-Fi) platform, and a courier\\n\\nA sample of the additional artifacts obtained from our analysis is available for download from our [website](https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/threat-reports/redline-stealer-ioc-analysis-and-expansion?mc=circleid).\\n\\n#### RedLine Stealer IoC Analysis\\n\\nOur analysis covered 990 unique domains and IP addresses tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs by CloudSEK and ThreatFox. We looked into their string usage, WHOIS details, IP geolocation data, and resolutions. Below are the details of our findings.\\n\\n##### String Analysis of the IoCs\\n\\nSeveral domains tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs appeared to lure victims into downloading free or cracked versions of software. The word cloud below reflects that, with the most common strings used being \\u201cfree,\\u201d \\u201ccrack,\\u201d and \\u201csoftware.\\u201d\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852a.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852a.jpg)\\n\\nThe IoCs mostly fell under the .com and .org generic top-level domain (gTLD) spaces. We also saw some new gTLDs, such as .xyz, .tech, .top, .pro, and .space, as shown in the chart below. In some cases, the threat actors registered the second-level domains (SLDs) using different TLDs. For example, the domain string \\u201ccracksoftware\\u201d appeared with .site and .space extensions.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852b.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852b.jpg)\\n\\n##### WHOIS Characteristics of the IoCs\\n\\nWe ran the malicious domains on [Bulk WHOIS Lookup](https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-api/?mc=circleid) to retrieve their complete WHOIS information. Most of them were registered with Namecheap and Reg.ru, with each accounting for 28% of the total registration.\\n\\nAlmost all of the domains were created between July and November 2022. We also identified the most-used name server reflected in the image below.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852c.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852c.jpg)\\n\\nAbout 31% of the IoCs were registered in Iceland and all had redacted WHOIS records protected by Withheld for Privacy EHF. Consistent with that, 84% of the domains had redacted WHOIS records. Still, we found five public registrant email addresses. We expanded these findings in later sections.\\n\\n##### IP Geolocation Analysis\\n\\nWe ran all the IoCs on [Bulk IP Geolocation](https://ip-geolocation.whoisxmlapi.com/bulk-gui/?mc=circleid) to see how many still had IP resolutions and pinpoint their geolocations and administrators. About 92% of the RedLine Stealer IoCs currently resolved to IP addresses.\\n\\nAs shown in the chart below, most of the IP hosts were geolocated in the Netherlands, Russia, Germany, and the U.S.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852d.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852d.jpg)\\n\\nOn the other hand, the top ISPs included Hetzner Online GmbH and Partner LLC, Delis LLC, Amazon.com, Inc., and 106 others. The chart below shows the top 10 ISPs.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852e.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852e.jpg)\\n\\n##### Content Hosted on the IoCs\\n\\nAbout half of the domains tagged as IoCs had active IP resolutions, with some still hosting or redirecting to a variety of web content. Here are a few examples.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852f.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852f.jpg)\\n\\n#### IoC Expansion: Uncovering Additional Suspicious Domains\\n\\n##### WHOIS-Connected Artifacts\\n\\nWe used the findings from our IoC analysis to uncover more domains possibly connected to RedLine Stealer. On [Reverse WHOIS](https://drs.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search?mc=circleid), we used some of the domains\\u2019 common WHOIS characteristics and text strings. These search strings were specifically used:\\n\\n*   **Registrar name:** _Starts with_ Namecheap\\n*   **Name server:** _Starts with_ DNS1.REGISTRAR-SERVERS.COM\\n*   **Creation date:** _From_ 1 July - 20 December 2022\\n\\nAside from these search parameters, we also specified the SLDs so the tool would only return those that contained specific string combinations. The table below shows the strings and examples of the connected domains we found. More domain samples can be found in the Appendix.\\n\\n\\u201cSoftware\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cCrack\\u201d\\n\\nnostr\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\nrevosoftware\\\\[.\\\\]company  \\nreversed\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\ncarbonsparksoftware\\\\[.\\\\]blog  \\ncarbonsparksoftware\\\\[.\\\\]cloud\\n\\ncrackedbedwars\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\npccracked\\\\[.\\\\]org  \\nsoft-warecrack\\\\[.\\\\]store  \\ncrack-soft-ware\\\\[.\\\\]store  \\ncrackedprograms\\\\[.\\\\]co.uk\\n\\n\\u201cFree\\u201d + \\u201cWare\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSoftware\\u201d + \\u201cApp\\u201d\\n\\nfreesoftwaredownload\\\\[.\\\\]net  \\nfreewaregadgets\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nfreesoftwaresystem\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nfreesoftwareapk\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\ndesignsoftwarefree\\\\[.\\\\]com\\n\\ncodeapp\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\napplicationsoftwaredevelopment\\\\[.\\\\]com  \\nvpmapping\\\\[.\\\\]software  \\nbootstrappedsoftware\\\\[.\\\\]partners  \\nsoftwareapp\\\\[.\\\\]online\\n\\nWe found 1,756 domains potentially connected to RedLine Stealer based on similar WHOIS details and string usage. While some may be legitimate software businesses, many hosted adult content and other suspicious pages.\\n\\nSome examples include freesoftwareapk\\\\[.\\\\]com, which offers free software and features download buttons for each product, and softwareaktualisierung\\\\[.\\\\]live, which offers support services for Microsoft users. However, its WHOIS details can\\u2019t be attributed to the imitated organization.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852g.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852g.jpg)\\n\\n##### IP-Connected Artifacts\\n\\nAnother reliable way to find more properties connected to the threat is to look at shared IP hosts. To do that, we used [Reverse IP/DNS API](https://dns-history.whoisxmlapi.com/?mc=circleid) and found that 98% of the IP addresses tagged as RedLine Stealer IoCs had 50 or fewer resolving domains. That may indicate they were dedicated IP addresses.\\n\\nWe found 750 IP-connected artifacts, some of which have already figured in malicious campaigns, including cybersquatting domains targeting Canada Post, Santander Bank, Scotia Bank, and Uniswap. Alarmingly, the Uniswap-related malicious domains continued to host content as shown below.\\n\\n[![](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852h.jpg)](https://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/13852h.jpg)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThreat analysis is critical to understanding malicious actors\\u2019 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). A more targeted IoC analysis can lead to suspicious and possibly dormant weapons.\\n\\nBy shedding light on the DNS footprints of public RedLine Stealer IoCs, we uncovered a total of 2,506 possible threat artifacts. Our analysis of the related properties shows that some have already figured in malicious campaigns, while others were suspicious.\\n\\n**_If you wish to perform a similar investigation or get access to the full data behind this research, please don\\u2019t hesitate to [contact us](https://main.whoisxmlapi.com/security-research-partnerships?action=show&subject=modal&id=contactUsModal&mc=threatreport)._**\"}, {\"title\": \"What is InfoStealer Malware and How Does It Work?\", \"link\": \"https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-is-infostealer-malware-and-how-does-it-work/\", \"snippet\": \"<strong>InfoStealer</strong> malware plays a key role in many cyber attacks, enabling extortion and lateral movement via stolen credentials. Learn the fundamentals about <strong>InfoStealers</strong> in this article.\", \"content\": \"Cyberattacks are not random but rather follow a set of methodical and somewhat tactics and techniques. [The Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), developed by Lockheed Martin, details the sequential phases of a cyber attack: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. Attacker tactics and techniques can be mapped using models such as the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.\\n\\nFollowing these known strategies, after gaining unauthorized initial access, the installation phase allows the attacker to establish a foothold, and through command and control (C2), they maintain ongoing access to the compromised environment.\\n\\nDuring these middle stages InfoStealer malware often comes into play. InfoStealer malware is a type of malicious software specifically designed to extract sensitive information from an infected system. The stolen information can be leveraged to extort victims, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid, or sold on the blackmarket to other organized criminal organizations.\\u00a0 Furthermore, if the stolen information contains the victim's credentials such as username, passwords, or private keys, the attacker can use them to compromise other systems, furthering their attack.\\n\\nIn this article we will provide a comprehensive review of InfoStealer malware, what information it targets, how it operates, and list the most prolific InfoStealer malware strains. By understanding the role of InfoStealer malware organizations can better prepare and respond to the intricate landscape of cyber threats they face today.\\n\\nWhat is InfoStealer Malware?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware, as its name suggests, is a type of malicious software designed specifically to gather sensitive information from infected systems. This category of malware targets personal, financial, and business data, which can include passwords, [credit card numbers](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/pci-penetration-test/), browsing history, and other valuable information. The ultimate goal of InfoStealers is to transmit this stolen data to cybercriminals who can use it for financial gain, identity theft, or further malicious activities.\\n\\nInfoStealers often enter systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or [compromised websites](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/heres-how-you-can-defend-against-drive-by-compromise-attacks/). Once installed, they can operate quietly in the background, making them particularly hard to detect. They may also employ various techniques to avoid detection, maintain persistence, find other valuable targets on a network, and allow attackers to issue commands remotely. The most sophisticated InfoStealers are modular; they can import specific payloads after scanning the environment for potential sources of valuable information.\\n\\nHow Do InfoStealers Work?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware employs a variety of techniques to target and extract specific types of data from infected systems. Each strain of malware that is classified as a InfoStealer has different capabilities ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated modular malware. It's also important to remember that data can be stolen from a system using native built-in OS tooling known as a [Living Off The Land (LOTL)](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-living-off-the-land-attacks/) attack.\\n\\nEach method discussed below targets specific types of data or input-output peripherals. Each method also leverages unique vulnerabilities associated with how that data is used, stored, and transmitted. The diversity of these techniques underscores the necessity for comprehensive security measures that protect not just against one type of threat but a broad array of infiltration strategies.\\n\\nHere are some ways that InfoStealer malware operates:\\n\\n*   **Keylogging**: One of the most common tactics, keylogging involves recording keystrokes made by a user. By capturing everything typed, attackers can later filter out passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive personal information\\n    \\n*   **Form Grabbing**: This technique is used to intercept data submitted in forms on web pages before it is encrypted by the browser. It's particularly effective for stealing login credentials, payment information, and other data entered on websites\\n    \\n*   **Clipboard Hijacking**: InfoStealers can monitor and modify the clipboard content on an infected device. When a user copies data such as account numbers or passwords, the malware replaces or steals this information. This attack technique can even steal usernames and passwords as they are auto-filled by a [password manager](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/password-manager-breach/)\\n    \\n*   **Screen Capturing**: By taking screenshots of the user\\u2019s screen at critical moments\\u2014such as while entering credentials or viewing personal information\\u2014this method can bypass text-based data extraction limitations, capturing data displayed on the screen in any form\\n    \\n*   **Browser Session Hijacking**: This method involves stealing cookies and session tokens from a browser's cached memory which can allow cybercriminals to impersonate the victim's online session, gaining unauthorized access to online accounts without needing a username and password\\n    \\n*   **Credential Dumping**: This method extracts data from user accounts stored on the system, such as login credentials saved in web browsers or other client software. If they are stored in encrypted format, attackers will attempt to crack them offline using specialized hardware and software tools\\n    \\n*   **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: These are more sophisticated attacks where the malware injects malicious code [into the web browser itself](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/how-safe-are-your-browsers/). This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate information in real-time as it is entered on secure websites\\n    \\n*   **Email Harvesting**: The malware searches through files and emails stored on the computer to collect email addresses and other contact information, which can be used for spamming or further phishing attacks\\n    \\n*   **Crypto-Wallet Harvesting:** Some InfoStealer malware can search known installation paths for common crypto-wallet software and attempt to steal private keys. Once in the attacker's possession these keys can be used to transfer the victim's cryptocurrency to attacker controlled accounts\\n    \\n\\nThe Most Prolific Strains of InfoStealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstimating the exact number of InfoStealer malware strains is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of malware and the frequent emergence of new variants. However, cybersecurity experts and researchers generally agree that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different strains of InfoStealer malware in existence. This vast range includes everything from well-documented and widely recognized strains to more obscure or specialized ones that target specific geographic regions or sectors.\\n\\n*   [**Zeus (Zbot)**](https://www.cynet.com/malware/zeus-malware-variants-methods-and-history/)**:** Perhaps the most infamous InfoStealer, Zeus primarily targets financial information. First identified in 2007, it has been responsible for numerous cybercrimes, including banking fraud and the formation of botnets. Zeus is known for its ability to elude detection by using stealth techniques and its capability to replicate and distribute itself\\n    \\n*   [**Ursnif (Gozi)**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0386/)**:** Ursnif is another banking Trojan that has been active for over a decade. Ursnif is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, modular design, and its ability to steal a wide variety of data types, including banking credentials and personal identifiable information (PII). Ursnif is typically spread through exploit kits and phishing emails\\n    \\n*   [**Agent Tesla**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331/)**:** Agent Tesla is a sophisticated spyware that functions primarily as a keylogger and a remote access trojan (RAT). First identified around 2014, it is capable of monitoring and collecting the victim's keyboard inputs, system clipboard, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating credentials from a variety of software installed on the victim\\u2019s machine. Agent Tesla is often distributed via malicious email attachments, disguised as legitimate files or links that execute the malware upon opening\\n    \\n*   [**LokiBot**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0447/)**:** LokiBot, first detected in 2015, is an information stealer that targets multiple platforms to steal a variety of credentials such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data. It also has modular functionalities to download and execute additional malicious payloads giving the attacker remote access. LokiBot is typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious software installers, and compromised websites\\n    \\n*   [**TrickBot**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/)**:** Originally identified in 2016, TrickBot has evolved from a banking trojan into a sophisticated multi-purpose malware capable of launching ransomware attacks and providing attackers with remote access to infected systems. TrickBot spreads through malspam campaigns and exploits vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. TrickBot is often considered one of the most sophisticated strains of malware with diverse capabilities\\n    \\n*   [**Raccoon Stealer**](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/raccoon-infostealer)**:** Raccoon Stealer is an information-stealing malware that emerged in 2019, known for its ease of use for low-skilled attackers, and its ability to extract a wide range of personal data. This malware steals credentials, web session cookies, and credit card data from browser caches, and searches for cryptocurrency wallets to extract private keys. Raccoon Stealer spreads via malicious email campaigns and exploit kits, leveraging its simplicity and effectiveness to appeal to a wide range of cybercriminals, including those with limited technical expertise\\n    \\n*   [**Redline Stealer**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)**:** Redline Stealer, first observed in 2020, is a relatively new but rapidly popular malware designed to steal passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive data stored in web browsers. It can also collect details about the infected system\\u2019s environment in order to facilitate secondary attacks such as privilege escalation and maintaining persistence. Redline Stealer is typically distributed through phishing campaigns, malicious advertisements, and bundled with cracked software, highlighting the risks of downloading unverified software from the internet\\n    \\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nInfoStealers represents a distinct type of malware, adept at extracting sensitive information from compromised systems, and plays a crucial role during the middle stages of a cyber attack\\u2014post-initial access. It targets a wide range of data, from personal and financial information to credentials that facilitate lateral movements within networks or enable extortion schemes.\\u00a0 Understanding the nature and function of InfoStealer malware is essential for organizations seeking to enhance their defensive strategies against an increasingly sophisticated array of cyber threats.\\n\\nLooking for more deep-dives on topics related to InfoStealer malware and other cybersecurity news?

Ducktail malware is typically delivered through a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. Once the malware infects a system, it establishes a persistent presence and begins to gather information about the system and the network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis info-stealer is being disseminated through Facebook URLs, employing a technique that redirects users to suspicious websites or pages. Once redirected, users are prompted to manually click on a download button, which initiates the download of malicious files onto their devices. This method of distribution capitalizes on user interaction and engagement to deceive them into downloading the malware. The malicious files obtained through this process pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of the affected users, potentially leading to various harmful consequences such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, system compromise, or further malware infections.\\n\\n![Image 33](https://cdn-igifd.nitrocdn.com/LjFqjuxPeeUzGqzhGkddQHQrbKmisRar/assets/images/optimized/rev-c5d0e80/www.rewterz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/an-emerging-ducktail-infostealer.png)\\n\\nThe research team has been analyzing a series of info-stealing malware, and they have recently come across an interesting campaign involving the PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer. This malware is being actively distributed by disguising itself as a free or cracked application installer for popular software, including games, Microsoft Office applications, and Telegram. Ducktail Infostealer, attributed to a Vietnamese threat group, has been active since 2021 and has primarily targeted Facebook Business accounts to manipulate pages and gain access to financial information.\\n\\nThe Ducktail Infostealer instances were first identified in late 2021. In July 2022, researchers observed that the threat actors were specifically targeting higher-level employees with access to Facebook Business accounts to steal data and take control of the accounts. The earlier versions of Ducktail were based on a binary written in .NET Core and utilized Telegram as its command and control (C2) channel for exfiltrating data. However, in August 2022, a new campaign was observed involving a PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer with new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\\n\\nAccording to an analysis, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting specific employees with administrative or financial access to Facebook Business accounts to a broader audience. The malicious executable files are typically in .ZIP format and are hosted on file-sharing platforms, posing as cracked or free versions of popular applications like Office, games, subtitles, and explicit content files. Compared to previous campaigns, changes have been made in the execution of the malicious code. The threat actors now employ a scripting version where the main stealer code is a PHP script instead of a .NET binary.\\n\\nThe execution flow begins with a fake installer that generates a temporary file, which then re-initiates the installer with a \\\"/Silent\\\" parameter. Another temporary file is created, which drops all the supporting files and malicious files at a specific location on the victim's machine. To achieve persistence, a series of events take place, scheduling tasks to execute the malicious payload, named \\\"libbridged.exe,\\\" daily and at regular intervals.\\n\\nThe stealing of data and its exfiltration are achieved by decrypting the stealer code at runtime in memory. The PHP script performs various actions, such as fetching browser information, extracting stored browser cookies, targeting Facebook Business accounts, searching for cryptocurrency account information in the wallet.dat file, and sending the collected data to the command and control (C&C) server.\\n\\nThe PHP script creates PHP associative arrays to prepare for data transmission to the C&C server. The CURL command is used for sending and receiving files over HTTP, and specific switches are employed during communication.\\n\\nThe script also collects information about installed browsers, retrieves data from the local state file in the Chrome user data directory, decodes sensitive data protected by Chrome's local data encryption, encodes stolen information to base64, and saves it to log files. It specifically targets Facebook pages, including Facebook API graph, Facebook Ads Manager, and Facebook Business accounts, to gather account details, payment cycles, account statuses, funding sources, and other relevant information.\\n\\nAfter completing the data-stealing activities, the PHP script connects to the C&C server to obtain a list of targeted folders and URLs stored in JSON format, which are then used to gather further information. The stolen data is sent to the C&C server in JSON format.\\n\\nTo conclude, the threat actors behind the Ducktail Infostealer campaign are continuously evolving their delivery mechanisms and tactics to steal a wide range of sensitive user and system information, particularly targeting Facebook Business accounts.\\n\\nImpact\\n------\\n\\n*   Sensitive Information Theft\\n*   Credential Theft\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise\\n------------------------\\n\\n#### Domain Name\\n\\n*   bwtraining.nl\\n*   dj-w.nl\\n*   ductri.shop\\n*   evdgoudsmid.nl\\n*   fsh-kpn.nl\\n*   funatfunction.nl\\n*   hakotrailers.nl\\n*   laterremadit.fr\\n*   lwdzuid.nl\\n*   nano-phone.fr\\n*   sgf-advies.nl\\n*   singano.shop\\n*   thediverse.se\\n*   zaoui.nl\\n*   dfgdfgfdgdfgdfg.shop\\n*   dausoviettelpro.online\\n*   insiktnordahl.se\\n\\n#### MD5\\n\\n*   de8d2f3a429b72be0b3fa968e89554c1\\n*   aa424dafb152c8696d472c001463b498\\n*   42df34c8cddcb2ebf793869d4220cc2b\\n*   b5fb2e07d7f0353c9648976d0cd2d9de\\n*   0f548b327788e6352eb262a138c1f87b\\n*   019c5102755e3f50e4d44ca82c9626ef\\n*   c1d0c76c34e1eb3588b05547dede3529\\n*   30e9e32a73933af3083b584af7858a3a\\n*   5cfc95d5f595963bb00c3d6ad96949e9\\n*   424ea05ac23ba6a504c1b193b6c5bcaf\\n*   512be004172b5715d881e0551d99590a\\n*   cff1b30dabdb292a22fa38c65df0bd40\\n*   5ec0d1215f205e9b4e8cd8d8f4095987\\n*   0f47b858719fbd7def7fd7f42b228cc0\\n*   d0b361bab520a5c1ee7c33aa1321100f\\n\\n#### SHA-256\\n\\n*   90523861a28cf8a33cfb2681fcbf029a16d353aea24d7fc47850af420e68835c\\n*   26dcfbc7cb948a84d5a24df6ebe9641a2a6201512aef5def698418a8e25e1fb0\\n*   c84c2d3be279f5eea89b6a40989a7511896c826b62341707971370f817e9b1c9\\n*   1b7d6e68479b6779b3992775faad0224beb3cc572c974b48ab184fec96012693\\n*   2187eab7da2eda3425f76ef8a051d83706304da3457a0188573a0a8d67fbc82b\\n*   5c7296ee878788c0fed596cac75498f11e218fa783fd1f4c92df8994f52049cc\\n*   73d7739688d8ae59c95cb14ea212ab5eedcd10e22cbed323cfbb072de139bc42\\n*   bab2ce1025546d4f5e988c85328d22ed7182dec9e741bcf2010ae0ff7ac5a031\\n*   8b9706472cbac5ddc24bd904b796d2fca6ba0729278ea6a1304815828db57da7\\n*   217bb8f973660942a6272a38702579f32e92f9f14b1f3287900fadb1dd28a542\\n*   0cebcb2df28653ec969bb2961abc2b74e666829f620a53705dcfad8d2c6362b6\\n*   10f158890c91e819b5a80ac17ae3bb96e98fe3a0c2dd97efac0c92b70ac00604\\n*   4c7b635e100b52c3a1ae92630b1933ab51baea8dea2646015b52ac4495887ce4\\n*   4ea385d2ecf3b53ad909c69a05e2906ca5e91be55eb5e12286fa516b516b8889\\n*   663221ff71dc932f91d4a9f6ecbb77cd1afc8d93f77a1e7e4f7d1fc3280dee93\\n\\n#### SHA-1\\n\\n*   86285bb8af48913b041374df15cceeaabb853498\\n*   8e1d5da5924df66077495191c8d5a3b6e1252eb3\\n*   a564a1d75214f10d1d9ef9cab0eb32d7db3008c0\\n*   29d40663e3222ef728cca4d838729325a5a81d5a\\n*   fbd3fecf461ec1de949bdd81a7695e1a11fa37e6\\n*   446e4a72f692bd48407ca073957df7dbbc86764c\\n*   66d7224339e16c08947e8ff7f8ea98b0197977a5\\n*   5d4d4ebcd6a6c7a3194fdd1d7f12ea1fa659bbb8\\n*   7372273c7f1d0417eb3c003395e7f6ddad8c39b0\\n*   5ca4cc70b71208bc3edef432edd01540874054e7\\n*   faaf431589e8121b2af3fa6b8fcffb2286055c9a\\n*   7e20c34516060af5468959edf848e26c1e1747bc\\n*   fa13cfffbfe4303114daa91686a08cb37c908157\\n*   51ea1ac2f86993ebd8b11df5417feaca8a42f55d\\n*   622b8eef1a0491d8e2f57d0c24c9fdd003510c60\\n\\nRemediation\\n-----------\\n\\n*   Block all threat indicators at your respective controls. Search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in your environment utilizing your respective security controls.\\n*   Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts adds an extra layer of security and can help prevent unauthorized access even if your login credentials have been stolen.\\n*   Regularly backing up your important data can help ensure you don't lose any critical information in the event of a malware infection or other data loss event.\\n*   Be wary of emails, attachments, and links from unknown sources. Also, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources or clicking on suspicious ads or pop-ups.\\n*   Make sure all of your software, including your operating system and applications, is up-to-date with the latest security patches. This can help prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by info-stealers and other types of malware.\\n*   Promptly apply security patches and updates for operating systems, software applications, and browsers. This helps to address vulnerabilities that threat actors may exploit to deliver malware.\\n*   Utilize web filtering solutions and URL reputation services to block access to known malicious websites and prevent users from visiting potentially dangerous links, such as those used in Ducktail infostealer campaigns.\\n*   Implement network segmentation to restrict access and isolate critical systems, such as those hosting sensitive financial information or Facebook Business accounts. This prevents lateral movement of malware and limits the impact of a potential compromise.\\n*   Implement robust monitoring solutions to detect any unusual or suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration. Establish an effective incident response plan to quickly respond to and mitigate any potential breaches.\\n*   Maintain regular backups of critical data, including Facebook Business account information, and ensure they are stored securely offline. This enables quick recovery in case of a successful attack or data loss.\\n\\n \\n\\n#### Platform\\n\\n*   [Rewterz XDR](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-xdr)\\n*   [Rewterz Defense](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-defense)\\n*   [Rewterz Threat Intelligence](https://www.rewterz.com/rewterz-threat-intelligence)\\n\\n#### Managed Security Services\\n\\n*   [Managed Security Monitoring](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring)\\n*   [Remote SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n*   [Onsite SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n*   [Hybrid SOC](https://www.rewterz.com/managed-security-services/managed-security-monitoring/#remote)\\n\\n#### Assess\\n\\n*   [Compromise Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/compromise-assessment)\\n*   [APT Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/advanced-persistent-threats-assessment)\\n*   [Penetration Testing](https://www.rewterz.com/services/penetration-testing)\\n*   [Architecture Design & Review](https://www.rewterz.com/services/secure-architecture-design-review)\\n*   [Red Team Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/red-team-assessment)\\n*   [Purple Team Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/purple-team-assessment)\\n*   [Social Engineering](https://www.rewterz.com/services/social-engineering)\\n*   [Source Code Review](https://www.rewterz.com/services/source-code-review)\\n\\n#### Transform\\n\\n*   [SOC Consultancy](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy)\\n*   [SOC Maturity Assessment](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-maturity-assessment)\\n*   [SOC Model Evaluation](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-model-evaluation)\\n*   [SOC Gap Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-gap-analysis)\\n*   [SIEM Gap Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/siem-gap-analysis)\\n*   [SIEM Optimization](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/siem-optimization)\\n*   [SOC Content Pack](https://www.rewterz.com/services/soc-consultancy/soc-content-pack)\\n\\n#### Train\\n\\n*   [Simulated Cyber Attack Exercise](https://www.rewterz.com/services/simulated-cyber-attack-exercise)\\n*   [Tabletop Exercise](https://www.rewterz.com/services/tabletop-exercise)\\n*   [Security Awareness and Training](https://www.rewterz.com/services/security-awareness-and-training)\\n\\n#### Respond\\n\\n*   [Incident Analysis](https://www.rewterz.com/services/incident-analysis)\\n*   [Incident Response](https://www.rewterz.com/services/incident-response)\\n\\n#### Threat Insights\\n\\n*   [Threat Advisories](https://www.rewterz.com/threat-advisory)\\n*   [Monthly Threat Insights](https://www.rewterz.com/monthly-threat-insights)\\n*   [Threat Intelligence Reports](https://www.rewterz.com/threat-intelligence-reports)\\n\\n#### Resources\\n\\n*   [Blog](https://www.rewterz.com/blog)\\n*   [Press Releases](https://www.rewterz.com/press-releases)\\n*   [Events](https://www.rewterz.com/event-page)\\n\\n#### Connect With Us\\n\\n*   [Contact](https://www.rewterz.com/contact)\\n*   [Careers](https://www.rewterz.com/careers)\\n\\n![Image 34](blob:https://www.rewterz.com/242b3fe432c022466a1d4043b71af5f1)\\n\\nCOPYRIGHT \\u00a9 REWTERZ.

The stolen information is then packaged, sent to the attacker, and often traded on illicit markets to other [cybercriminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_criminals \\\"Cyber criminals\\\").\\n\\nInfostealers usually consist of two parts: the bot framework that allows the attacker to configure the behaviour of the infostealer on the victim's computer, and a management panel that takes the form of a server to which the infostealer sends data. Infostealers infiltrate devices through [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing \\\"Phishing\\\") attacks, infected websites, and malicious software downloads including [video game mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_mods \\\"Video game mods\\\") and [pirated software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_software \\\"Pirated software\\\"), among other methods. Once downloaded, the infostealers gather sensitive information about the user's device and send the data back to the server.\\n\\nInfostealers are usually distributed under the malware-[as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service \\\"As a service\\\") (MaaS) model, where [developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer \\\"Programmer\\\") allow other parties to use their infostealers for subscription fees. This allows people with different levels of technical knowledge to deploy an infostealer. The functionality of infostealers can vary, with some focused on [data harvesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_harvesting \\\"Data harvesting\\\"), while others offer [remote access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan \\\"Remote access trojan\\\") that allows additional malware to be executed. [Stolen data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach \\\"Data breach\\\") may then be used in [spearphishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearphishing \\\"Spearphishing\\\") campaigns for other cyber-attacks, such as the deployment of [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\").\\n\\nThe proliferation of infostealer-as-a-service providers has contributed to an increase in the number of [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \\\"Computer security\\\") incidents involving infostealers. The number of stolen [data logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing) \\\"Logging (computing)\\\") being sold on the Russian Market, a [cybercrime forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_forum \\\"Crime forum\\\"), has increased significantly since 2022. According to [Kaspersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab \\\"Kaspersky Lab\\\")'s research in mid-2023, 24% of malware offered as a service are infostealers.\\n\\nIn [cybercrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime \\\"Cybercrime\\\"), credential theft is a well-known mechanism through which malicious individuals steal [personal information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data \\\"Personal data\\\") such as [usernames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usernames \\\"Usernames\\\"), [passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password \\\"Password\\\"), or [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie \\\"HTTP cookie\\\") to illegitimately gain access to a victim's online accounts and computer. This crime typically unfolds in four stages, with the first being the acquisition of the stolen credentials. Infostealers are a specific type of [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware \\\"Malware\\\"), that are designed for this initial stage. They usually consist of two distinct parts: the bot framework and a [command and control server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_server \\\"Command and control server\\\"), often known as the management panel or interface.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)\\n\\nThe bot framework includes a builder that allows the attacker to configure how the infostealer will behave on a user's computer and what kind of information it will steal. The management interface, usually written in traditional [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development \\\"Web development\\\") languages like [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP \\\"PHP\\\"), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML \\\"HTML\\\"), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript \\\"JavaScript\\\")[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2) is typically hosted on the commercial [cloud infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_infrastructure \\\"Cloud infrastructure\\\").[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-3) The management interface primarily functions as a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server \\\"Web server\\\") to which the infostealer send confidential information. The interface also provides the attacker with information about the status of the deployed infostealers and allows the attacker to control the behavior of the infostealers.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)\\n\\nDistribution and use\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infostealer&action=edit&section=2 \\\"Edit section: Distribution and use\\\")\\\\]\\n\\nInfostealers are commonly distributed through the malware-[as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service \\\"As a service\\\") (MaaS) model, enabling individuals with varying technical knowledge to deploy these malicious programs. Under this model, three distinct groups typically emerge: developers, malware service providers, and operators. Developers, the most technically skilled, write the infostealer code. Malware service providers purchase licenses for the malware and offer it as a service to other cybercriminals. The operators, who can be developers or service providers themselves depending on their skill level, use these services to perform [credential theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft \\\"Identity theft\\\").[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)\\n\\nOnce the malware is purchased, it is spread to target victim machines using various [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) \\\"Social engineering (security)\\\") techniques. [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing \\\"Phishing\\\"), including [spear phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_phishing \\\"Spear phishing\\\") campaigns that target specific victims, are commonly employed. Infostealers are commonly embedded in [email attachments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_attachment \\\"Email attachment\\\") or malicious links that link to websites performing drive-by downloads.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance1-4) Additionally, they are often bundled with compromised or malicious [browser extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension \\\"Browser extension\\\"), infected [game mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mods \\\"Game mods\\\"), and pirated or otherwise compromised software.[\\\\[4\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance1-4) After the stealer is downloaded and run by a victim, it communicates with the attacker's [command and control servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-and-control_server \\\"Command-and-control server\\\"), allowing the attacker to steal information from the user's computer. While most infostealers primarily target credentials, some also enable attackers to remotely introduce and execute other malware, such as [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\"), on the victim's computer.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-1)[\\\\[5\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-ryan-5)\\n\\nCredentials obtained from infostealer attacks are often distributed as logs or credential dumps, typically shared on paste sites like [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin \\\"Pastebin\\\"), where cybercriminals may offer free samples, or sold in bulk on underground hacking forums often for amounts as low as $10.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6)[\\\\[7\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance2-7) Buyers of these stolen credentials usually log in to assess their value, particularly looking for credentials associated with financial services or linked to other credentials with similar patterns, as these are especially valuable.[\\\\[8\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance6-8) High-value credentials are often sold to other cybercriminals at higher prices,[\\\\[9\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance7-9) who may then use them for various crimes, including [financial fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_fraud \\\"Financial fraud\\\"),[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance8-10) integrating the credentials into [zombie networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_network \\\"Zombie network\\\") and reputation boosting operations[\\\\[10\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-finance8-10) or as springboards for more sophisticated attacks such as scamming businesses, distributing ransomware, or conducting state-sponsored espionage.[\\\\[11\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-11)[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) Additionally, some cybercriminals use stolen credentials for [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) \\\"Social engineering (security)\\\") attacks, impersonating the original owner to claim they have been a victim of a crime and soliciting money from the victim\\u2019s contacts.[\\\\[12\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-what_happen-12)[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-imc353-13) Many buyers of these stolen credentials take precautions to maintain access for longer periods, such as changing passwords, using [Tor networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network) \\\"Tor (network)\\\") to obscure their locations, which helps avoid detection by services that might otherwise identify and shut down the stolen credentials.[\\\\[12\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-what_happen-12)[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-imc353-13)\\n\\nAn infostealers primary function is to exfiltrate sensitive information about the victim to an attacker's [command and control servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-and-control_server \\\"Command-and-control server\\\"). The exact type of data that is exfiltrated will depend on the data-stealing features enabled by the operator and the specific variant of infostealer used.[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-14) Most infostealers however, do contain functionality to harvest a variety of information about the host operating system, and system settings and user profiles. Some more advanced infostealers include the capability to introduce secondary malware like [remote access trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Access_Trojans_(RATs) \\\"Remote Access Trojans (RATs)\\\") and [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware \\\"Ransomware\\\").[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2)\\n\\nIn 2009, researchers at the [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_Digital \\\"Gen Digital\\\") Rapid Response team released a technical analysis of the [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(malware) \\\"Zeus (malware)\\\") infostealer, one of the first infostealers to be created.[\\\\[15\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-15) They found that the malware automatically exfiltrated all data stored in a computer's protected storage service (which was usually used by [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer \\\"Internet Explorer\\\") to store passwords) and tries to capture any passwords sent to the computer using the [POP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3 \\\"POP3\\\") and [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol \\\"File Transfer Protocol\\\") protocol. In addition to this, the malware allowed the researchers to define a set of configuration files to specify a list of web injections to perform on a user's computer as well as another configuration file that controlled which web [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL \\\"URL\\\") the malware would monitor. Another configuration also allowed the researchers to define a set of rules that could be used to test if additional [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP \\\"HTTP\\\") requests contained passwords or other sensitive information.[\\\\[16\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-symantec-16)\\n\\nMore recently, in 2020, researchers at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eindhoven_University_of_Technology \\\"Eindhoven University of Technology\\\") conducted a study analyzing the information available for sale on the underground credential [black-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market \\\"Black market\\\") impaas.ru. As part of their study, they were able to replicate the workings of a version of the [AZORult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZORult \\\"AZORult\\\") infostealer. Amongst the functions discovered by the researchers was a builder which allowed operators to define what kind of data would be stolen. The researchers also found evidence of plugins that stole a user's [browsing history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsing_history \\\"Web browsing history\\\"), a customizable [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression \\\"Regular expression\\\") based mechanism that allows the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from a user's computer, a browser password extractor module, a module to extract [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype \\\"Skype\\\") history and a module to find and exfiltrate [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency \\\"Cryptocurrency\\\") wallet files.[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-14)\\n\\nThe researchers also found that the data most frequently stolen using the AZORult infostealers and sold on the black market could be broadly categorized into three main types: fingerprints, cookies, and resources. [Fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint \\\"Device fingerprint\\\") consisted of identifiers that were constructed by probing a variety of features made available by the browser. These were not tied to a specific service but were considered to be an accurately unique identifier for a user's browsers. [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie \\\"HTTP cookie\\\") allowed buyers to [hijack a victim's browser session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking \\\"Session hijacking\\\") by injecting it into a browser environment. Resources refer to browser-related files found on a user's operating system, such as password storage files.[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-impaas1669-70-17)\\n\\nEconomics and impact\\n--------------------\\n\\n\\\\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infostealer&action=edit&section=4 \\\"Edit section: Economics and impact\\\")\\\\]\\n\\nSetting up an infostealer operation has become increasingly accessible due to the proliferation of stealer-as-a-service enterprises, significantly lowering financial and technical barriers. This makes it feasible for even less sophisticated cybercriminals to engage in such activities.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5308-5309-2) In a 2023 paper, researchers from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech \\\"Georgia Tech\\\") noted that the hosted stealer market is extremely mature and highly competitive, with some operators offering to set up infostealers for as low as $12.[\\\\[18\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5309-18) For the service providers running these stealer operations, the researchers estimated that a typical infostealer operator incurs only a few one-off costs: the license to use the infostealer which is obtained from a malware developer, and the registration fee for the domain used to host the [command and control server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_server \\\"Command and control server\\\"). The primary ongoing cost incurred by these operators is the cost associated with hosting the servers. Based on these calculations, the researchers concluded that the stealer-as-a-service business model is extremely profitable, with many operators achieving profit margins of over 90% with revenues in the high thousands.[\\\\[19\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-usenix5318-19)\\n\\nDue to their extreme profitability and accessibility, the number of cybersecurity incidents that involve infostealers has risen.[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) The [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 \\\"COVID-19\\\") post-pandemic shift towards [remote and hybrid work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work \\\"Remote work\\\"), where companies give employees access to enterprise services on their home machines has also been cited as one of the reasons behind the increase in the effectiveness of infostealers.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-scmedia-20)[\\\\[6\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-wired-6) In 2023, research by [Secureworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secureworks \\\"Secureworks\\\") discovered that the number of infostealer logs\\u2014data exfiltrated from each computer\\u2014being sold on the Russian Market, the biggest underground market increased from 2 million to 5\\u00a0 million logs from June 2022 to February 2023.[\\\\[20\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-scmedia-20) According to [Kaspersky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab \\\"Kaspersky Lab\\\")'s research in mid-2023, 24% of malware offered as a service are infostealers.[\\\\[21\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_note-register-21)\\n\\n1.  ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infostealer#cite_ref-usenix5308_1-0)

It was known to target credentials of online banking services. The code of ZeuS was leaked and then many variants of it were created.\\n\\nInfostealer malware is designed to steal data after a single run, and it usually removes itself from the system. These typically operate as malware as a service (MaaS), a business model in which the developers of malicious software lease their malware to others for a fee. This arrangement allows almost anyone to deploy an infostealer regardless of their technical know-how.\\n\\n**What information is collected by infostealers?**\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTypical information stolen by this type of malware include:\\n\\n*   Computer information such as hostname, username, IP address and OS details.\\n*   Data from browsers such as credentials, credit card numbers, cookies and autofill forms.\\n*   Other types of information such as cryptocurrency wallets, VPN clients\\u2019 data, other applications\\u2019 credentials (i.e., Steam, Discord, etc.) and any plain-text passwords stored on the system.\\n\\n  \\n**Why are they so dangerous?**\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware is known to steal not only saved credentials but also session tokens, which can help threat actors to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA). As a result, infostealers can provide threat actors with immediate account access without requiring the use of more sophisticated tools or staying active in an environment for long time.\\n\\nConfidential data stolen by infostealers is later offered through the darknet or other cybercriminal forums. Once bought, this information can fuel further malicious activities. The nature of activities performed by threat actors varies according to the value of the stolen information.\\n\\nWhile compromised credit cards or bank accounts might have individual consequences such as fraudulent transactions, etc., it\\u2019s not uncommon for users to save credentials to corporate browsers. From an attacker\\u2019s perspective, this type of data is low-hanging fruit that can allow quick access to corporate networks \\u2014 which could lead to serious consequences such as ransomware infection.\\n\\n  \\n**How does a system get infected with an infostealer?**\\n----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe most common methods used by infostealers are:\\n\\n*   Phishing email: Threat actors commonly deliver infostealers via email. This can be through an attachment or tricking users into clicking on a URL within the email.\\n*   Search engine ads: Currently, the most frequent and effective distribution method of infostealer malware is through search engine ads. Threat actors masquerade phishing sites to mimic legitimate websites. Using Google or Bing ad features, attackers position such malicious sites to appear first in the search-engine results for a particular software.\\n*   Cracked/pirated software: Often, users are seen trying to download cracked software and compromising their system with infostealers.\\n*   Infected pen drives: Systems get infected with infostealer or other malware that copies itself to external drives such USB or pen drives. Then, when the drive connects to another system, that system gets infected as well. The technique is usually seen in .LNK malware that tricks users into clicking a file that looks like shortcut to the pen drive itself. However, clicking on the file initiates a connection to a command-and-control server from which the payload is downloaded.\\n*   YouTube videos: YouTube users are offered free game cheats within the videos. Clicking the link in the description box instead downloads an infostealer.\\n\\n  \\n**Case study**\\n-----------------\\n\\nA recent breach investigated by Atos Computer Security Incident Response Team about ransomware infection in one of the customer environment revealed the following course of action.\\n\\nA user, working from a corporate device, used their personal Google Account\\u2019s password synchronization feature to save their corporate VPN credentials in the browser. The same Google account was used on his private device as well, which meant the VPN credentials were synced to this device.\\n\\nThe user downloaded cracked software to their personal device. The infostealer malware infected the personal device, and threat actors were able to obtain the VPN credentials along with other stored credentials. This account was then used by threat actors to access the corporate environment. After data exfiltration, ransomware was deployed across other devices in the corporate environment. This also highlighted the requirement of MFA which was found to be missing in this case.\\n\\n  \\n**Infostealer trends**\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe below chart shows top user accounts compromised by infostealers. Note: Most targeted user accounts are Microsoft or Google accounts, which are also in many cases used by corporations. It also shows other social accounts.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://atos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIGURE-1-TOP-COMPROMISED-USERS.png)  \\n_Source \\u2013 Hudson Rock_\\n\\nThe graph below shows top infostealers seen in worldwide attacks. Note: Redline, Raccoon and Vidar contribute the most compromises worldwide.\\n\\n![Image 2](https://atos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIGURE-2-TOP-INFOSTEALERS.png)\\n\\n_Source \\u2013 Hudson Rock_\\n\\nBelow are the top mobile applications compromised by infostealers.\\n\\n![Image 3](https://atos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIGURE-3-TOP-COMPROMISED-APP-USERS-ANDROID.png)\\n\\n_Source \\u2013 Hudson Rock_\\n\\nSee below the number of users compromised by infostealer malware. This chart shows a significant increase in 2022.\\n\\n![Image 4](https://atos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/FIGURE-4-NUMBER-OF-COMPROMISED-USERS-1024x711.png)  \\n_Source \\u2013 Hudson Rock_\\n\\n  \\n**How to protect your organization from infostealers**\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n### The following practices will help reduce the risk of infostealer infection.\\n\\n*   Conduct regular user security awareness training: In most attacks, users are the weakest link no matter how sophisticated your security tools are. So user training is very important, specifically on spotting fake/spoofed email. Users should stay vigilant when opening any email from unknown senders and report any suspicious emails to your security operations center for analysis.\\n\\n*   Scan/limit email attachments: Scan email attachments at the gateway level to check for malicious content. Block known malicious file extensions at the gateway level.\\n\\n*   Use MFA for all applications: MFA acts as an additional layer to protect users even if the user account gets compromised.\\n\\n*   Use password manager for storing and generating complex passwords, and do not store passwords in browsers.\\n\\n*   Deploy an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution on all endpoints: This way, even if a user opens a malicious attachment or clicks on a malicious URL, EDR will be able to detect, alert and block the threat.\\n\\n*   Block search-engine ads: Block search-engine ads at the proxy or web gateway level, or use ad-blockers to prevent malicious ads.\\n\\n*   Limit admin rights: Do not give admin rights to users. Whenever there is need of such rights, temporary permission can be assigned dynamically.\\n\\n*   Block unwanted applications through Microsoft Intune: Intune policies such as Windows Defender Application Control management prevent users from installing pirated/cracked software.\\n\\n*   Do not synchronize credentials between corporate and private devices: For example, don\\u2019t use private Google account sync features.\\n\\n*   As Defense strategy monitor what is available on the Dark Web within DRPS (Digital Risk Protection Services) which includes continuous monitoring of compromised credentials with technology like\\u00a0[Hudson Rock Cavalier.](https://www.hudsonrock.com/cavalier)\\n\\n[Hudson Rock](https://www.hudsonrock.com/)\\u00a0is an Israel company, which is utilizing cybercrime intelligence and forensic technologies that helps prevent ransomware attacks and data breaches caused by infostealer infections.
