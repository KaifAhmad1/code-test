            "Text: Companies    NEW DELHI, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Star Health  (STAU.NS) , India's biggest health insurer, on Saturday said it had received a ransom demand of $68,000 from a cyberhacker in connection with a leak of customer data and medical records.  Star, which has a roughly $4 billion market cap, is battling a reputational and business crisis since Reuters reported on Sept. 20 that a hacker had used Telegram chatbots and a website to leak customers' sensitive data, including tax details and medical claim papers. The company, whose shares have declined 11%, has launched internal investigations and has taken legal action against Telegram and the hacker, whose website continues to share samples of Star customers' data. Star, which has previously said it is a \"victim of a targeted malicious cyberattack\", on Saturday revealed for the first time that in August \"the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email\" addressed to the company's managing director and its chief executive. The statement came after Indian stocks exchanges sought clarifications from Star on a Friday over a Reuters report that the company was investigating allegations that its chief security officer was involved in the data leak. Star reiterated on Saturday it has found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja, though the internal investigation is ongoing. Telegram has declined to share the account details or permanently ban accounts linked to the hacker - an individual dubbed xenZen - \"despite multiple notices issued in this regard,\" Star said on Saturday. Star said it has \"sought the assistance\" of Indian cyber security authorities to \"help us identify\" the hacker. Telegram did not respond to a request for comment. The Dubai-based messenger app has previously said it removed the chatbots when Reuters flagged them to the platform.

            "Text: An alarming wave of cyberattacks is sweeping across  , compromising millions of personal records as tech analysts say stronger regulations and other countermeasures are needed to plug the critical weaknesses in the nation’s digital infrastructure. “Various sectors, including healthcare, education, government, and critical infrastructure, have been particularly hard hit,” said Diwakal Dayal, India-based vice president of SentinelOne, a global cybersecurity firm. “These sectors often struggle with underfunded   measures, making them attractive targets for malicious actors.” In recent weeks, major entities including Star Health Insurance, the Supreme Court’s YouTube channel, and the popular podcast BeerBiceps have fallen victim to cyberattacks, leading to significant data breaches and temporary shutdowns. A hacker infiltrated Star Health Insurance, accessing 7.24 terabytes of data and compromising the personal data of up to 3.1 million people, and demanded a ransom from the company in August. Details taken from the system of India’s largest health insurer, including names, birthdays, tax identities and confidential medical records, have been uploaded for sale online for US$150,000 and caused a sharp decline in its share price.\n",

            "Text: Indian health insurer Star Health says it has received an email containing a ransom of $68,000 following a \"targeted malicious cyberattack\". The attack allegedly resulted in the leak of personal data of up to 31 million Star Health policy holders and over 5.8 million insurance claims. The health organization confirmed that the cyberattack resulted in \"unauthorized and illegal access to certain data\" including full names, postal addresses, phone numbers, medical reports, and insurance claims. Since the attack, the company has suffered serious reputational damage and an 11% drop in shares, and has also launched legal action against Telegram, since Telegram chatbots were used to leak the information. A mountain of information  The stolen data was reported to total a staggering 7.24 terabytes, although it is not yet confirmed exactly what information was taken. Health Star is said to have sought the assistance of Indian cybersecurity authorities in its investigation. Although the hacker alleged that Chief Information Security Officer Amarjeet Khanuja was involved in the breach, the organization is yet to identify any wrongdoing - but the internal investigation is ongoing. “We also want to categorically mention that our CISO has been duly co-operating in the investigation, and we have not arrived at any finding of wrongdoing by him till date. We request that his privacy be respected as we know that the threat actor is trying to create panic” the insurer commented. Telegram have declined to comment on account details or permanently ban accounts linked to the hacker, an individual dubbed ‘xenZen’, despite \"multiple notices issued in this regard\", the Star has revealed.

            "The intrusions linked to Transparent Tribe involve the use of a malware called ElizaRAT and a new stealer payload dubbed ApoloStealer on specific victims of interest, Check Point said in a technical write-up published this week.\n",
            "\"ElizaRAT samples indicate a systematic abuse of cloud-based services, including Telegram, Google Drive, and Slack, to facilitate command-and-control communications,\" the Israeli company said.\n",
            "ElizaRAT is a Windows remote access tool (RAT) that Transparent Tribe was first observed using in July 2023 as part of cyber attacks targeting Indian government sectors. Active since at least 2013, the adversary is also tracked under the names APT36, Datebug, Earth Karkaddan, Mythic Leopard, Operation C-Major, and PROJECTM.\n",
            " \n",
            "Its malware arsenal includes tools for compromising Windows, Android, and Linux devices. The increased targeting of Linux machines is motivated by the Indian government's use of a custom Ubuntu fork called Maya OS since last year.\n",
            "Infection chains are initiated by Control Panel (CPL) files likely distributed via spear-phishing techniques. As many as three distinct campaigns employing the RAT have been observed between December 2023 and August 2024, each using Slack, Google Drive, and a virtual private server (VPS) for command-and-control (C2).\n",
            "ApoloStealer is designed to gather files matching several extensions (e.g., DOC, XLS, PPT, TXT, RTF, ZIP, RAR, JPG, and PNG) from the compromised host and exfiltrate them to a remote server.\n",
            "In January 2024, the threat actor is said to have tweaked the modus operandi to include a dropper component that ensures the smooth functioning of ElizaRAT. Also observed in recent attacks is an additional stealer module codenamed ConnectX that's engineered to search for files from external drives, such as USBs.\n",
            "   \n",
            "The abuse of legitimate services widely used in enterprise environments heightens the threat as it complicates detection efforts and allows threat actors to blend into legitimate activities on the system.\n",
            "\"The progression of ElizaRAT reflects APT36's deliberate efforts to enhance their malware to better evade detection and effectively target Indian entities,\" Check Point said. \"Introducing new payloads such as ApolloStealer marks a significant expansion of APT36's malware arsenal and suggests the group is adopting a more flexible, modular approach to payload deployment.\"\n",
