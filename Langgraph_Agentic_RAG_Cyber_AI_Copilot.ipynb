We eliminated the threat actor’s access to the environment and found no evidence of additional compromise or threat actor activity beyond what we previously disclosed as impacted in January.

            "Our investigation to date has determined that a threat actor exfiltrated encrypted backups from a third-party cloud storage service related to the following products: Central, Pro, join.me, Hamachi, and RemotelyAnywhere. We also have evidence that a threat actor exfiltrated an encryption key for a portion of the encrypted backups. The affected information, which varies by product, may include account usernames, salted and hashed passwords, a portion of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) settings, as well as some product settings and licensing information. In addition, while Rescue and GoToMyPC encrypted databases were not exfiltrated, MFA settings of a small subset of their customers were impacted. \n",
            "At this time, we have no evidence of exfiltration affecting any other GoTo products other than those referenced above or any of GoTo’s production systems.\n",
            " We are contacting affected customers directly to provide additional information and recommend actionable steps for them to take to further secure their accounts. Even though all account passwords were salted and hashed in accordance with best practices, out of an abundance of caution, we will also reset the passwords of affected users and/or reauthorize MFA settings where applicable. In addition, we are migrating their accounts onto an enhanced Identity Management Platform, which will provide additional security with more robust authentication and login-based security options. \n",

In reality, however, the victims are routed to an actor-controlled call center and connected to a live agent on the other end, who ends up installing a remote access tool for persistence.\n",
            "\"The attacker will then seek to identify valuable information on the victim's computer and connected file shares, and they will quietly exfiltrate it to a server they control using a file transfer tool,\" Unit 42 researcher Kristopher Russo said.\n",

            "The campaign may be resource intensive, but is also technically less sophisticated and likely to have a much higher success rate than other phishing attacks.\n",

            "The Luna Moth actor, also known as Silent Ransom, has become an expert of sorts when it comes to pulling off such schemes. According to AdvIntel, the cybercrime group is believed to be the mastermind behind the BazarCall attacks last year.\n",
            " \n",
            "To give these attacks a veneer of legitimacy, the adversaries, instead of dropping a malware like BazarLoader, take advantage of legitimate tools like Zoho Assist to remotely interact with a victim's computer, abusing the access to deploy other trusted software such as Rclone or WinSCP for harvesting data.\n",
            "Extortion demands range from two to 78 Bitcoin based on the organization targeted, with the threat actor creating unique cryptocurrency wallets for each payment. The adversary is also said to offer discounts of nearly 25% for prompt payment, although there's no guarantee that the data is deleted.\n",
            "\"The threat actors behind this campaign have taken great pains to avoid all non-essential tools and malware, to minimize the potential for detection,\" Russo said. \"Since there are very few early indicators that a victim is under attack, employee cybersecurity awareness training is the first line of defense.\"\n",

We believe several IT servers may have been accessed by an unauthorized third-party. We do not believe any customer content was compromised. The teams are actively working through the processes.\n",
            "1-5-2023 7:00 AM Pacific: Our investigation with internal and third party forensic teams concluded that there was no live attack on 12/2/2022, but that the post was instead related to a September 2022 incident.\n",
            "In September 2022, we identified and mitigated an attempted ransomware attack in real-time, and removed the attacker from an 8x8 internal IT network segment. Our investigation identified a limited number of IT servers at issue, none of which involved our 8x8 UCaas and CCaaS production systems or customer content (customer information that is transmitted through our SaaS service such as voicemails, phone numbers, call records, etc.). We provided notice of the incident to relevant data protection authorities and believed that the incident had been contained.\n",
            "Based on contact with the threat actor after the 12/2/2022 post, we have determined that the unauthorized third party in the September attack had exfiltrated a limited amount of business records, including 2018 payment authorization forms for a small number of current EU region customers, and some employee payroll data in EMEA. We are in the process of reaching out to all impacted customers and employees with next steps.\n",

            "Text: The North Korean 'Lazarus' hacking group is linked to a new attack spreading fake cryptocurrency apps under the made-up brand, \"BloxHolder,\" to install the AppleJeus malware for initial access to networks and steal crypto assets.\n",
            "According to a joint FBI and CISA report from February 2021, AppleJeus has been in circulation since at least 2018, used by Lazarus in cryptocurrency hijacking and digital asset theft operations.\n",
            "A new report by Volexity has identified new, fake crypto programs and AppleJeus activity, with signs of evolution in the malware's infection chain and abilities.\n",
            "New BloxHolder campaign\n",
            "The new campaign attributed to Lazarus started in June 2022 and was active until at least October 2022.\n",
            "In this campaign, the threat actors used the \"bloxholder[.]com\" domain, a clone of the HaasOnline automated cryptocurrency trading platform.\n",
            "  Legitimate (left) and clone website (right) (Volexity)   \n",
            "This website distributed a 12.7MB Windows MSI installer that pretended to be the BloxHolder app. However, in reality, it was the AppleJeus malware bundled with the QTBitcoinTrader app.\n",
            "In October 2022, the hacking group evolved their campaign to use Microsoft Office documents instead of the MSI installer to distribute the malware.\n",
            "The 214KB document was named 'OKX Binance &amp; Huobi VIP fee comparision.xls' and contained a macro that creates three files on a target's computer.\n",
            "Volexity couldn't retrieve the final payload from this later infection chain, but they noticed similarities in the DLL sideloading mechanism found in the previously used MSI installer attacks, so they're confident it's the same campaign.\n",
            "Upon installation through the MSI infection chain, AppleJeus will create a scheduled task and drop additional files in the folder \"%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Bloxholder\\\".\n",
            "Next, the malware will collect the MAC address, computer name, and OS version and send it to the C2 via a POST request, likely to identify if it's running on a virtual machine or sandbox.\n",
            "One novel element in recent campaigns is chained DLL sideloading to load the malware from within a trusted process, evading AV detection.\n",
            "\"Specifically, \"CameraSettingsUIHost.exe\" loads the \"dui70.dll\" file from the \"System32\" directory, which then causes the loading of the malicious \"DUser.dll\" file from the application's directory into the \"CameraSettingsUIHost.exe\" process,\" explains Volexity.\n",
            "\"The \"dui70.dll\" file is the \"Windows DirectUI Engine\" and is normally installed as part of the operating system.\"\n",
            "  Chained DLL sideloading (Volexity)   \n",
            "Volexity says the reason Lazarus opted for chained DLL sideloading is unclear but might be to impede malware analysis.\n",
            "Another new characteristic in recent AppleJeus samples is that all its strings and API calls are now obfuscated using a custom algorithm, making them stealthier against security products.\n",
            "Although Lazarus' focus on cryptocurrency assets is well documented, the North Korean hackers remain fixed on their goal to steal digital money, constantly refreshing themes and improving tools to stay as stealthy as possible.\n",
            "Who is the Lazarus Group\n",
            "The Lazarus Group (also tracked as ZINC) is a North Korean hacking group that has been active since at least 2009.\n",
            "The group gained notoriety after hacking Sony Films in Operation Blockbuster and the 2017 global WannaCry ransomware campaign that encrypted businesses worldwide.\n",
            "Google discovered in January 2021 that Lazarus was creating fake online personas to target security researchers in social engineering attacks that installed backdoors on their devices. A second attack using this tactic was discovered in March 2021.\n",
            "The U.S. government sanctioned the Lazarus hacking group in September 2019 and now offers a reward of up to $5 million for information that can disrupt their activities.\n",
            "More recent attacks have turned to the spreading of trojanized cryptocurrency wallets and trading apps that steal people's private keys and drain their crypto assets.\n",
            "In April, the U.S. government linked the Lazarus group to a cyberattack on Axie Infinity that allowed them to steal over $617 million worth of Ethereum and USDC tokens.\n",
            "It was later revealed that the Axie Infinity hack was made possible due to a phishing attack containing a malicious PDF file pretending to be a job offer sent to one of the company's engineers.\n",
