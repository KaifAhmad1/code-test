            "Text: A new attack recently surfaced in the DeFi space, this time a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting both developers and users. In this post, we explain what we learnt from the attack and how we are making sure it won’t happen again.  On October 30, 1inch encountered a security incident involving a widely used third-party UI animations library, @lottiefiles/lottie-player, which was compromised, leading to significant risks for applications and wallets interacting with it.  This breach affected certain users’ wallets through a sophisticated method, which has since been fully mitigated by the 1inch team. Importantly, 1inch’s protocols, wallet, and API were not affected.  The attack was identified at 2:31pm PDT. The 1inch team took immediate actions to neutralize the threat and fully resolved the issue by 3:22 PDT. The anatomy of the attack The attacker managed to compromise @lottiefiles/lottie-player, a widely-used UI animations library. This incident shows possible risks of using widely adopted software packages, which can pose serious threats when compromised. The 1inch team believes that the attacker gained access to the library by exploiting compromised secrets from one of the library’s contributors. Once inside, the attacker injected malicious code into the library's updates. This change allowed the library to display a seemingly safe popup requesting a wallet connection, while malicious code was silently running in the background. Once a wallet was connected, the attacker selectively requested extensive permissions to transfer tokens from the address - leading to a partial compromise either immediately or with a delay.   The moment these permissions were granted, the tokens stored in the affected wallets became vulnerable and were often drained without the user's knowledge. It is crucial for everyone in the DeFi community-developers and users alike-to take this incident as a lesson in the hidden dangers of supply chain vulnerabilities. How 1inch was affected and what the response was 1inch used lottie-player by referencing it through an external URL, meaning the library was loaded directly from an external server instead of being hosted locally within the 1inch infrastructure. It’s important to note that only the 1inch dApp was affected by this incident. Other products, such as the 1inch Wallet, all the protocols and APIs, remained entirely unaffected. The compromised library was swiftly identified thanks to @pcaversaccio, who alerted the 1inch team about the issue. Immediately after receiving this information, a group of experts within 1inch was assembled to investigate and mitigate the threat. During the investigation, the 1inch team discovered that the compromised version of the library had been used. In response, 1inch acted swiftly to roll back to a verified safe version, ensuring the malicious code was completely removed from the 1inch dApp. Furthermore, the attacker’s drainer account was identified shortly after the incident. This identification helped verify real victims and assess the extent of the losses suffered by those affected. Security measures and recommendations Supply chain attacks like this one are a sobering reminder of how deeply dependent the DeFi community is on external software libraries and packages. Let's dive into some practical steps to reduce the risk. 1. Be cautious with wallet permissions The lottie-player attack used a clever strategy: a popup requesting wallet permissions. In DeFi, such requests are common, but they shouldn't be taken lightly. It’s good practice to always verify  which dApp is asking for permissions and who the spender is . Also, it’s advisable not to give broad permissions unless absolutely necessary, and keep an eye on permission prompts that appear out of context. Tools like  Pocket Universe  and  Wallet Guard  can help identify potential risks before you confirm a transaction. Being careful with permissions can often mean the difference between maintaining control of your assets and losing them. 2. Audit and revoke permissions regularly It's possible that wallets affected by this attack have not yet been drained, as there could be a delay. If you have interacted with a compromised library or have any doubts, act now. Use services like  Revoke.cash  to audit your permissions. Revoke unnecessary or suspicious approvals to stay ahead of potential attackers. Consider setting up a schedule to regularly check wallet permissions, especially for wallets that have interacted with multiple dApps and libraries. This proactive approach can significantly reduce risks. 3. Don’t use @latest in production code It might be tempting to point a dependency to @latest to ensure the most recent version is being used. However, this relinquishes control over what exactly is being deployed in an application. The malicious code injected into @lottiefiles/lottie-player was present in a new release. Automatic updates pulled in the infected version unknowingly. Instead, explicitly declare your version of the dependencies and audit each update before integrating them into your application. The goal is to ensure that you know exactly what’s being used and have the opportunity to verify each change. 4. Properly manage dependencies One thing to avoid is blindly trusting any library, no matter how popular. Always do your own research, especially when adopting new updates or dependencies. When feasible, use tools to monitor the integrity of your dependencies and track changes across versions. Dependency management tools like npm audit or yarn audit can help detect vulnerabilities, but a human review is still necessary. Take the time to check contributors and recent changes, especially for libraries that have broad access to your application’s functionality. Stay vigilant, stay safe The recent attack on @lottiefiles/lottie-player highlights a significant vulnerability for DeFi users and developers. 1inch continues to remain committed to further strengthening dependency monitoring and implementing additional safeguards to mitigate future risks. This incident underscores the importance of vigilance in third-party dependency management. 1inch keeps working diligently to enhance the ecosystem’s security practices and remains vigilant about possible future incidents. The DeFi world is full of opportunities, but it also comes with unique risks. We highly recommend that you stay informed, verify before trusting and always remember that your vigilance is the best defense against threats.

            "SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file zshenv.\n",
            "The campaign, which we dubbed ‘Hidden Risk’, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.\n",
            "Overview\n",
            "Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "In early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\n",
            "In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\n",
            "Infection Vector\n",
            "Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\n",
            "The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\n",
            " The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right) \n",
            "Unlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.\n",

            "The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org. The full URL currently serves a benign form of the Bitcoin ETF document with titles that differ over time. However, at some point, this URL has or does switch to serving the first stage of a malicious application bundle entitled ‘Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app’ (3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb).\n",

            "In July 2024, the operational technology (OT)-centric malware FrostyGoop/BUSTLEBERM became publicly known, after attackers used it to disrupt critical infrastructure. The outage occurred after the Cyber Security Situation Center (CSSC), affiliated with the Security Service of Ukraine, disclosed details [PDF] of an attack on a municipal energy company in Ukraine in early 2024.\n",
            "FrostyGoop is the ninth reported OT-centric malware, but the first that used Modbus TCP communications to impact the power supply to heating services for over 600 apartment buildings. FrostyGoop can be used both within a compromised perimeter and externally if the target device is accessible over the internet. FrostyGoop sends Modbus commands to read or modify data on industrial control systems (ICS) devices, causing damage to the environment where attackers installed it.\n",
            "Based on this reporting, we conducted a deeper analysis and uncovered new samples of FrostyGoop and other related indicators. These new indicators include configuration files and libraries used by the malware, as well as artifacts associated with an infection. We also investigate network communications and provide new insights based on open-source intelligence (OSINT) data and our own telemetry.\n",
            "OT malware is an increasing concern of security professionals across the globe, and FrostyGoop provides a notable case study of this growing threat.\n",

            "  Technical Analysis of FrostyGoop\n",
            "Attackers employed this malware associated with Russian actors in a cyberattack that caused a two-day heating system outage affecting over 600 apartment buildings in Ukraine, during sub-zero temperatures.\n",
            "According to an open-source report, attackers made the initial compromise through a vulnerability in a MikroTik router. However, we have not confirmed this delivery method and bad actors might instead have delivered the malware via OT devices exposed to the internet.\n",
            "FrostyGoop makes use of the Modbus TCP protocol to interact directly with ICS/OT devices, and therefore it is considered an ICS-centric malware. This is the ninth known ICS-centric malware.\n",
            "In addition, Modbus is one of the most common protocols used in critical infrastructure. During this attack, the adversaries dispatched Modbus commands to ENCO control devices, leading to inaccurate measurements and system malfunctions. Remediating these issues took nearly two days.\n",
            "Although bad actors used the malware to attack ENCO control devices, the malware can attack any other type of device that speaks Modbus TCP. Our telemetry indicates that 1,088,175 Modbus TCP devices were exposed to the internet from Sept. 2-Oct. 2, 2024, and 6,211,623 devices were exposed overall.\n",
            "The details needed by FrostyGoop to establish a Modbus TCP connection and send Modbus commands to a targeted ICS device can be provided as command-line arguments or included in a separate JSON configuration file.\n",
            "   Malware Samples Analysis \n",
            "FrostyGoop is compiled using the Go programming language, sometimes referred to as Golang. The malware uses a relatively obscure open-source Modbus implementation.\n",
            "Further analysis of the Modbus library revealed this implementation does not natively support supplying arguments using a JSON file, making this a strong identifier for the malware. Moreover, the JSON object structure follows a specific format based on the commands this malware supports. FrostyGoop also contains capabilities for logging the output to a console or to a JSON file.\n",
            "Attackers can supply two types of parameters to FrostyGoop:\n",
            "The first type of parameter consists of the possible operations an attacker can execute toward the registers of a Modbus device\n",
            "The second parameter consists of timing configurations.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows an example of the first type of parameter for an operation using Tasks and Iplist under the register for .\n",

            " Figure 3. Binary Ninja showing FrostyGoop timing configuration in the registry entry under . \n",
            "FrostyGoop also leverages Goccy’s go-json library, a faster JSON encoder and decoder compatible with the Go programming language standard package. In addition, it incorporates a specific open-source execution controller named queues. The relative obscurity of this code means it can serve as another possible indicator of FrostyGoop.\n",
            "Figure 4 shows our analysis of a Windows executable file for FrostyGoop within the tool Binary Ninja. This analysis reveals URLs from open-source libraries for modbus, go-json and queues.\n",
            " Figure 4. Open-source libraries: Modbus, go-json and queues. \n",
            "Although not all FrostyGoop samples contain the strings shown in Figure 4, other strings contained within those libraries can serve as part of the detection for this malware.\n",
            "FrostyGoop also implements a debugger evasion technique by checking the value in Windows' Process Environment Block (PEB). Figure 5 shows this method in the disassembled code from a FrostyGoop sample. This method provides an alternative way to check the PEB's flag without calling . Attackers use this technique to detect and avoid debuggers used by malware analysts.\n",

Also, we found Vietnamese comments in the PXA Stealer program, which further strengthen our assessment.\n",
            "The attacker’s Telegram account has biography data that includes a link to a private antivirus checker website that allows users or buyers to assess the detection rate of a malware program. This website provides a platform for potential threat actors to evaluate the effectiveness and stealth capabilities of the malware before purchasing it, indicating a sophisticated level of service and professionalism in the threat actor's operations.\n",
            "We also discovered that the attacker is active in an underground Telegram channel, “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” mainly selling Facebook accounts, Zalo accounts, SIM cards, credentials, and money laundry data. Talos observed that this Vietnamese actor is also seen in the Telegram group in which the CoralRaider actor operates. However, we are not certain whether the actor is a member of the CoralRaider gang or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker is also promoting another underground Telegram channel, “Cú Black Ads – Dropship,\" by sharing a few automation tools to manage large numbers of user accounts in their channel and conducting the exchanging or selling of information related to social media accounts, proxy services, and a batch account creator tool.\n",
            "The tools shared by the attacker in the group are automated utilities designed to manage several user accounts. These tools include a Hotmail batch creation tool, an email mining tool, and a Hotmail cookie batch modification tool. The compressed packages provided by the threat actor often contain not only the executable files for these tools but also their source code, allowing users to modify them as needed.\n",

            "We found that the attacker is not sharing all the tools for free, and some of them require users to send a unique key back to the Telegram channel administrator for software activation. This process ensures that only those who have been vetted or have paid for the tool can access its full functionality. We also discovered that these tools are distributed on other websites, such as aehack[.]com, highlighting that they are selling the tools. Additionally, a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBLueYeRugg) channel exists that provides tutorials on how to use these tools, further facilitating their widespread use and demonstrating the organized efforts to market and instruct potential users on their application.\n",

            "The attacker gains initial access by sending a phishing email with a ZIP file attachment, according to our telemetry data. The ZIP file contains a malicious loader executable file compiled in Rust language and a hidden folder called Photos. The hidden folder has other recurring folders, such as Documents and Images, that contain obfuscated Windows batch scripts and a decoy PDF document.\n",
            "When a victim extracts the attachment ZIP file, the hidden folder and the malicious Rust loader executable are dropped onto the victim machine. When the malicious Rust loader executable is run by the victim, it loads and executes multiple obfuscated batch scripts that are in the dropped hidden folders.\n",
            "We deobfuscated the Windows batch scripts using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), with each step in the process being crucial and requiring precise execution to achieve accurate deobfuscation. First, we employed regular expressions (regex) to filter out random characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z). These random strings ranged in length from six to nine characters and were enclosed within “%” symbols. Next, we filtered out the “^” symbols and removed any remaining uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z) as well as special characters “_,” /’(?),” “$,” “#,” and “[].” Finally, we eliminated the “%” symbols and we were able to successfully deobfuscate the scripts and reveal their PowerShell commands.\n",

            "Login credentials stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer executes another function, “get_ch_cookies”, to extract cookies from a specified browser's cookie database, decrypt them, and save the results to a file. First, it checks if the cookies database file exists in the specified profile directory and unlocks the cookies database file.

Then, it validates the decrypted Discord tokens to check if it is a legitimate Discord token and stores it by associating it with the browser name. Besides searching for the encrypted tokens, the function also looks for unencrypted Discord tokens by searching strings that match the regular expression pattern \"[\\w-]{24}\\.[\\w-]{6}\\.[\\w-]{27}\" for standard tokens and \"mfa\\.[\\w-]{84}\" for multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens in \".log\" and \".ldb\" files in the levelDB directory of Discord applications or web browsers where the structured key-value data is stored in levelDB database format.\n",

On Saturday, Signzy told TechCrunch it was aware of the security incident but declined to elaborate.\n",

            "One of the earliest samples identified as part of the campaign is an HTML Application (HTA) file that, when run, downloads a decoy PNG image from a remote server using the curl utility for Windows, while also stealthily retrieving and running another script (\"bat_install.bat\") from a different server using the BITSAdmin command-line tool.\n",
            "The newly downloaded script then proceeds to fetch using BITSAdmin several other files, including the NetSupport RAT malware, which establishes contact with a command-and-control (C2) server set up by the attackers.\n",

            "A subsequent iteration of the campaign observed in mid-May 2023 involved the intermediate JavaScript mimicking legitimate JavaScript libraries like Next.js to activate the NetSupport RAT infection chain.\n",
            "Kaspersky said it also found another variant of the JavaScript file that dropped an NSIS installer that's then responsible for deploying BurnsRAT on the compromised host.\n",
            "\"Although the backdoor supports commands for remotely downloading and running files, as well as various methods of executing commands via the Windows command line, the main task of this component is to start the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) as a service and send the RMS session ID to the attackers' server,\" Ushkov explained.\n",
            "\"RMS is an application that allows users to interact with remote systems over a network. It provides the ability to manage the desktop, execute commands, transfer files and exchange data between devices located in different geographic locations.\"\n",

            "In a sign that the threat actors continued to tweak their modus operandi, two other attack sequences spotted in late May and June 2023 came with a completely reworked BAT file for installing NetSupport RAT and incorporated the malware directly within the JavaScript code, respectively.\n",
            "There are indications that the campaign is the work of a threat actor known as TA569 (aka Gold Prelude, Mustard Tempest, and Purple Vallhund), which is known for operating the SocGholish (aka FakeUpdates) malware. This connection stems from overlaps in the NetSupport RAT license and configuration files used in respective activities.\n",
            "It's worth mentioning that TA569 has also been known to act as an initial access broker for follow-on ransomware attacks such as WastedLocker.\n",
            "\"Depending on whose hands this access falls into, the consequences for victim companies can range from data theft to encryption and damage to systems,\" Ushkov said. \"We also observed attempts to install stealers on some infected machines.\"\n",

Dec 2, 2024, 7:26 a.m.     Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin will shut down and transfer its accounts and assets to trading platform SBI VC Trade in March next year, it said in a statement on Dec. 2. The decision was made after the exchange suffered a hack in May. Hackers siphoned off over 4502.9 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $305 million at the time. DMM Bitcoin had restricted its services such as withdrawals and the acceptance of purchase orders for spot crypto assets since the loss of the funds, but acknowledged that allowing the situation to continue would impair its customers. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused over such a long period of time,” it said. Who was behind the theft is not clear – though fingers have been pointed at North Korea’s shadowy cyberhackers the Lazarus Group. Money from the hack also appears to have passed through Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian payments company that has enabled the laundering of billions in illicit funds. SBI VC Trade said that the company would start handling 14 cryptocurrency new spot trading that are already handled by DMM Bitcoin before the transfer of the assets.

            "Text: A new attack recently surfaced in the DeFi space, this time a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting both developers and users. In this post, we explain what we learnt from the attack and how we are making sure it won’t happen again.  On October 30, 1inch encountered a security incident involving a widely used third-party UI animations library, @lottiefiles/lottie-player, which was compromised, leading to significant risks for applications and wallets interacting with it.  This breach affected certain users’ wallets through a sophisticated method, which has since been fully mitigated by the 1inch team. Importantly, 1inch’s protocols, wallet, and API were not affected.  The attack was identified at 2:31pm PDT. The 1inch team took immediate actions to neutralize the threat and fully resolved the issue by 3:22 PDT. The anatomy of the attack The attacker managed to compromise @lottiefiles/lottie-player, a widely-used UI animations library. This incident shows possible risks of using widely adopted software packages, which can pose serious threats when compromised. The 1inch team believes that the attacker gained access to the library by exploiting compromised secrets from one of the library’s contributors. Once inside, the attacker injected malicious code into the library's updates. This change allowed the library to display a seemingly safe popup requesting a wallet connection, while malicious code was silently running in the background. Once a wallet was connected, the attacker selectively requested extensive permissions to transfer tokens from the address - leading to a partial compromise either immediately or with a delay.   The moment these permissions were granted, the tokens stored in the affected wallets became vulnerable and were often drained without the user's knowledge. It is crucial for everyone in the DeFi community-developers and users alike-to take this incident as a lesson in the hidden dangers of supply chain vulnerabilities. How 1inch was affected and what the response was 1inch used lottie-player by referencing it through an external URL, meaning the library was loaded directly from an external server instead of being hosted locally within the 1inch infrastructure. It’s important to note that only the 1inch dApp was affected by this incident. Other products, such as the 1inch Wallet, all the protocols and APIs, remained entirely unaffected. The compromised library was swiftly identified thanks to @pcaversaccio, who alerted the 1inch team about the issue. Immediately after receiving this information, a group of experts within 1inch was assembled to investigate and mitigate the threat. During the investigation, the 1inch team discovered that the compromised version of the library had been used. In response, 1inch acted swiftly to roll back to a verified safe version, ensuring the malicious code was completely removed from the 1inch dApp. Furthermore, the attacker’s drainer account was identified shortly after the incident. This identification helped verify real victims and assess the extent of the losses suffered by those affected. Security measures and recommendations Supply chain attacks like this one are a sobering reminder of how deeply dependent the DeFi community is on external software libraries and packages. Let's dive into some practical steps to reduce the risk. 1. Be cautious with wallet permissions The lottie-player attack used a clever strategy: a popup requesting wallet permissions. In DeFi, such requests are common, but they shouldn't be taken lightly. It’s good practice to always verify  which dApp is asking for permissions and who the spender is . Also, it’s advisable not to give broad permissions unless absolutely necessary, and keep an eye on permission prompts that appear out of context. Tools like  Pocket Universe  and  Wallet Guard  can help identify potential risks before you confirm a transaction. Being careful with permissions can often mean the difference between maintaining control of your assets and losing them. 2. Audit and revoke permissions regularly It's possible that wallets affected by this attack have not yet been drained, as there could be a delay. If you have interacted with a compromised library or have any doubts, act now. Use services like  Revoke.cash  to audit your permissions. Revoke unnecessary or suspicious approvals to stay ahead of potential attackers. Consider setting up a schedule to regularly check wallet permissions, especially for wallets that have interacted with multiple dApps and libraries. This proactive approach can significantly reduce risks. 3. Don’t use @latest in production code It might be tempting to point a dependency to @latest to ensure the most recent version is being used. However, this relinquishes control over what exactly is being deployed in an application. The malicious code injected into @lottiefiles/lottie-player was present in a new release. Automatic updates pulled in the infected version unknowingly. Instead, explicitly declare your version of the dependencies and audit each update before integrating them into your application. The goal is to ensure that you know exactly what’s being used and have the opportunity to verify each change. 4. Properly manage dependencies One thing to avoid is blindly trusting any library, no matter how popular. Always do your own research, especially when adopting new updates or dependencies. When feasible, use tools to monitor the integrity of your dependencies and track changes across versions. Dependency management tools like npm audit or yarn audit can help detect vulnerabilities, but a human review is still necessary. Take the time to check contributors and recent changes, especially for libraries that have broad access to your application’s functionality. Stay vigilant, stay safe The recent attack on @lottiefiles/lottie-player highlights a significant vulnerability for DeFi users and developers. 1inch continues to remain committed to further strengthening dependency monitoring and implementing additional safeguards to mitigate future risks. This incident underscores the importance of vigilance in third-party dependency management. 1inch keeps working diligently to enhance the ecosystem’s security practices and remains vigilant about possible future incidents. The DeFi world is full of opportunities, but it also comes with unique risks. We highly recommend that you stay informed, verify before trusting and always remember that your vigilance is the best defense against threats.

            "SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file zshenv.\n",
            "The campaign, which we dubbed ‘Hidden Risk’, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.\n",
            "Overview\n",
            "Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "In early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\n",
            "In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\n",
            "Infection Vector\n",
            "Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\n",
            "The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\n",

            "The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org.

            "The application bundle was signed and notarized on 19 October, 2024 with the Apple Developer ID “Avantis Regtech Private Limited (2S8XHJ7948)”. The signature has since been revoked by Apple.\n",

The vast majority of firewalls already follow this Palo Alto Networks and industry best practice. Please follow links for additional information regarding ensuring the management interface best practices: How to Secure the Management Access of Your Palo Alto Networks Device: https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431  We currently believe that neither Prisma Access nor cloud NGFW would be affected. Exploitation Status We have not seen any signs of exploitation. We will keep this bulletin updated if this situation changes. Please subscribe to the RSS feed, https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/rss.xml, or email notices at https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/SupportAccount/Preferences for notifications. Solution We will develop mitigations and solutions if needed, and when we become aware of the nature and specifics of the issue. Frequently Asked Questions Q.Is there active exploitation?  No, we are not aware of any malicious exploited activity.  Q.Are there any indicators of compromise?  No, we do not have sufficient information about any indicators of compromise.  Q.Can I use Xpanse and XSIAM to identify PAN-OS management interfaces?  Cortex Xpanse and Cortex XSIAM customers with the ASM module can investigate internet exposed instances by reviewing alerts generated by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall Admin Login attack surface rule.  Q.If the firewall management interface is deployed per best practices, do I need to take any action?  There is no further action needed at this time.  Timeline\n",

The script files – disguised as requests and bids from potential customers or partners – bear names such as “Запрос цены и предложения от Индивидуального предпринимателя &lt;ФИО&gt; на август 2024. АРТ-КП0005272381.js” (Request for price and proposal from sole trader &lt;name&gt; for August 2024.

Otek-mn0008522309.js), and the like.\n",
            "     Examples of malicious emails \n",
            "According to our telemetry, the campaign began around March 2023 and hit more than a thousand private users, retailers and service businesses located primarily in Russia. We dubbed this campaign Horns&amp;Hooves, after a fictitious organization set up by swindlers in the Soviet comedy novel The Golden Calf.\n",

            "Malicious scripts\n",
            "During the campaign, the threat actors made some major changes to the script, while keeping the same distribution method. In almost all cases, a JS script named “Заявка на закупку…” (“Purchase request…”), “Запрос цен…” (“Request for quote…”), or similar was sent in a ZIP archive. Far more rarely, the scripts were called “Акт сверки…” (“Reconciliation statement…”), “Заявление на возврат…” (“Request for refund…”), “Досудебная претензия…” (“Letter of claim…”) or just “Претензия…” (“Claim…”). The earliest versions that we encountered in April and May used scripts with the HTA extension instead of JS scripts.\n",
            "For believability, besides the script, the attackers sometimes added to the archive various documents related to the organization or individual being impersonated. For example, an archive attached to a booking cancellation email contained a PDF file with a copy of a passport; while price request emails had extracts from the Russian Unified State Register of Legal Entities, certificates of tax registration and company cards in attachment. Below, we examine several versions of the scripts used in this campaign.\n",

            "Version A (HTA)\n",
            "Some of the first sample scripts we saw in April and early May 2023 were relatively small in size. As an example, we analyzed a sample with the MD5 hash sum 327a1f32572b4606ae19085769042e51.\n",
            "     First version of the malicious script in attachment \n",
            "When run, the script downloads a decoy document from https://www.linkpicture[.]com/q/1_1657.png in the form of a PNG image, which it then shows to the user. In this case, the image looks like a screenshot of a table listing items for purchase. It may have been taken from a previously infected machine.\n",
            "     Decoy document in PNG format \n",
            "Note that PNG decoy documents are rather unconventional. Usually, bids and requests that are used to distract user attention from malware are distributed in office formats such as DOCX, XSLX, PDF and others. The most likely reason for using PNG is that in the very first versions the attackers hid the payload at the end of the bait file. PNG images make convenient containers because they continue to display correctly even after the payload is added.\n",
            "To download the decoy document, the attackers use the curl utility, which comes preinstalled on devices with Windows 10 (build 17063 and higher). Together with the document, using another built-in Windows utility, bitsadmin, the script downloads and runs the BAT file bat_install.bat to install the main payload. The script also makes use of bitsadmin for managing file transfer tasks.\n",

An incident can be any threat to an organisation’s network or information, even when an attack is unsuccessful or there is no confirmed compromise. An incident may include reconnaissance and network scanning, possible attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, accidental data leaks, or suspicious events.\n",

Recorded incidents may involve small businesses being targeted by financially motivated actors, or they may involve serious, persistent attempts to compromise the information systems of major New Zealand organisations. These include attempts to identify and steal valuable intellectual property. Some threats come from well-resourced foreign sources. These sources may target significant New Zealand organisations or use New Zealand systems to target overseas entities.\n",

This scale is based on processes described in the New Zealand Cyber Security Emergency Response Plan, found on the DPMC website(external link) . Minor incidents are categorised as C6, while highly significant incidents are categorised as C2 and national cyber emergencies are categorised C1. Highly significant incidents (C2 or above) involve substantial time and resources to address. Even significant (C3) or moderate incidents (C4) can still take a number of weeks to resolve, and usually require complex responses across a number of teams. For minor (C5) or routine incidents (C6), the NCSC might respond by providing general advice or alerts to customers. As examples, the denial-of-service attack affecting the New Zealand Stock Exchange in 2020 and the ransomware attack affecting the Waikato District Health Board in 2021 were both categorised C2.\n",

            "And get this - while we're all worried about regular hackers, there are now AI systems out there that can craft phishing emails so convincingly, that even cybersecurity experts have trouble spotting them. What's even crazier? Some of the latest malware is like a digital chameleon - it literally watches how you try to catch it and changes its behavior to slip right past your defenses.\n",

            " T-Mobile Spots Hackers Trying to Break In: U.S. telecom service provider T-Mobile caught some suspicious activity on their network recently - basically, someone was trying to sneak into their systems. The good news? They spotted it early and no customer data was stolen. While T-Mobile isn't pointing fingers directly, cybersecurity experts think they know who's behind it - a hacking group nicknamed 'Salt Typhoon,' which apparently has ties to China. What makes this really interesting is that these hackers have a brand new trick up their sleeve: they're using a previously unknown backdoor tool called GHOSTSPIDER. Think of it as a skeleton key that no one knew existed until now. They've been using this same tool to target telecom companies across Southeast Asia.\n",

In doing so, the idea is to execute malicious code before even initializing the operating system and bypass security measures, effectively granting the attackers absolute control over the system. While bootkits discovered to date have only targeted Windows machines, the discovery of Bootkitty indicates that it's no longer the case. That said, it's assessed to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) and there is no evidence that it has been put to use in real-world attacks.\n",

Cybersecurity firm Morphisec said it identified five significant NTLM vulnerabilities that could be exploited to leak the credentials via Malicious RTF Document Auto Link in Microsoft Word, Remote Image Tag in Microsoft Outlook, Remote Table Refresh in Microsoft Access, Legacy Player Files in Microsoft Media Player, and Remote Recipient List in Microsoft Publisher. Microsoft has acknowledged these flaws but noted that they are either by design or do not meet the bar for immediate servicing. It's recommended to restrict NTLM usage, enable SMB signing and encryption, block outbound SMB connections to untrusted networks, and switch to Kerberos-only authentication.\n",

            "Text: The UK is underestimating the severity of the online threat it faces from hostile states and criminal gangs, the country’s cybersecurity chief will warn. Richard Horne, the head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, will cite a trebling of “severe” incidents amid Russian “aggression and recklessness” and China’s “highly sophisticated” digital operations. In his first major speech as the agency’s chief, Horne will say on Tuesday that hostile activity in UK cyberspace has increased in “frequency, sophistication and intensity” from enemies who want to cause maximum disruption and destruction. In a speech at the NCSC’s London HQ, Horne, who took on the role in October, will point to “the aggression and recklessness of cyber-activity we see coming from Russia” and how “China remains a highly sophisticated cyber-actor, with increasing ambition to project its influence beyond its borders”. “And yet, despite all this, we believe the severity of the risk facing the UK is being widely underestimated,” he will say. One expert described the comments as a “klaxon” call to companies and public sector organisations to wake up to the scale of the cyber-threat facing the UK. Horne will make the warning as the NCSC reveals a significant increase in serious cyberincidents over the past 12 months. Its annual review shows that the agency had responded to 430 incidents requiring its support between 1 September 2023 and 31 August 2024, compared with 371 in the previous 12 months. It says that 12 of those attacks were at the “top end of the scale” and were “more severe in nature” – a trebling from the previous year. “There is no room for complacency about the severity of state-led threats or the volume of the threat posed by cybercriminals,” Horne will say. “The defence and resilience of critical infrastructure, supply chains, the public sector and our wider economy must improve.” Last week the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, warned that Russia “can turn the lights off for millions of people” with a cyber-attack. The NCSC review does not reveal the split between state-executed attacks and incidents perpetrated by criminal gangs. However, it is understood that a significant amount of its time is spent supporting organisations responding to ransomware attacks, where criminal gangs paralyse their targets’ IT systems and extract confidential data. The gangs then demand a ransom payment in bitcoin to return the stolen data. Recent ransomware attacks against high-profile UK targets include the British Library and Synnovis, which manages blood tests for NHS trusts and GP services. The NCSC says it received 317 reports of ransomware activity last year, of which 13 were “nationally significant”. “The attack against Synnovis showed us how dependent we are on technology for accessing our health services. And the attack against the British Library reminded us that we’re reliant on technology for our access to knowledge,” Horne will say. “What these and other incidents show is how entwined technology is with our lives and that cyber-attacks have human costs.” Ransomware gangs typically originate from Russia or former Soviet Union countries and their presence appears to be tolerated within Russia, provided they do not attack Russian targets. However, one Russian cybercrime gang, Evil Corp, has carried out attacks against Nato countries at the behest of state intelligence services, according to the UK’s National Crime Agency. Horne adds: “What has struck me more forcefully than anything else since taking the helm at the NCSC is the clearly widening gap between the exposure and threat we face, and the defences that are in place to protect us.” “And what is equally clear to me is that we all need to increase the pace we are working at to keep ahead of our adversaries.” It is understood the “underestimated” warning is directed at public and private sector organisations in the UK. The NCSC says the top sectors reporting ransomware activity this year were academia, manufacturing, IT, legal, charities and construction. The agency’s review says that the Russian regime, through its invasion of Ukraine, is inspiring non-state actors to carry out cyber-attacks against critical national infrastructure in the west. The review points to Chinese hackers such as the Volt Typhoon group, which has targeted US infrastructure and “could be laying the groundwork for future disruptive and destructive cyber-attacks” while in the UK Beijing-linked groups have targeted MPs’ emails and the Electoral Commission’s database. The report also warns that Iran “is developing its cyber-capabilities and is willing to target the UK to fulfil its disruptive and destructive objectives” while North Korean hackers were targeting cryptocurrency to raise revenue and attempting to steal defence data to improve Pyongyang’s internal security and military capabilities. The NCSC also believes that UK firms are almost certainly being targeted by workers from North Korea “disguised as freelance third-country IT staff to generate revenue for the DPRK regime”. Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said NCSC was warning the private and public sectors not to “take their eye off the ball”. “The government is trying to sound the klaxon,” he said. “The feeling is that not everybody is listening yet.”\n",

            "   Malware and Ransomware:  \n",
            "Malware and ransomware attacks are among the most pressing challenges. Ransomware attacks have evolved into a $20 billion industry, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Implementing advanced endpoint security solutions is crucial for protection.  \n",
            "   Social Engineering Attacks:  \n",
            "With the rise of cloud services, social engineering attacks like spear phishing and pretexting are more common. These attacks manipulate employees into revealing sensitive information. Enterprises must enforce security protocols, multi-factor authentication, and train employees to recognize these attacks.  \n",
            "   State-Affiliated Cyberattacks:  \n",
            "Cyberattacks linked to state-backed entities, often for political or warfare purposes, are on the rise. Recent attacks have targeted major organizations with ransomware and DDoS attacks, particularly in regions like Ukraine and Israel.  \n",
            "   Data Breaches:  \n",
            "Despite advances in cybersecurity technology, data breaches remain a significant threat. Attackers are finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. Data breaches can lead to severe fines and litigation, making data protection essential.  \n",
            "   Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scams:  \n",
            "BEC scams are becoming more prevalent, especially with the use of generative AI to craft convincing phishing emails. These scams can lead to significant financial losses as attackers trick employees into making fraudulent payments. Awareness programs and strong email security can reduce this risk.  \n",
            "   Artificial Intelligence (AI):  \n",
            "AI is being used by attackers to enhance and diversify their attacks. Tools like generative AI enable cybercriminals to create sophisticated phishing emails, malware, and deepfakes, making attacks harder to detect. AI can also be used to impersonate individuals or spread misinformation.  \n",
            "   Compromised Credentials and Tokens:  \n",
            "The shift to remote and hybrid work has made tokens and credentials a prime target for attackers. Misconfigured or insecurely stored tokens are often exploited, as seen in breaches like Microsoft’s Azure SAS token issues. Securing these credentials is critical to preventing unauthorized access.  \n",
            "   Mobile Device Risks:  \n",
            "Mobile devices are increasingly vulnerable as employees download malicious apps or compromise security with inadequate mobile device management (MDM). Attackers can exploit MDM vulnerabilities, leading to malware installation or data breaches. Implementing mobile security measures is vital.  \n",
            "   PIP Install Malware:  \n",
            "The use of open-source software introduces risks through insecure libraries and dependencies. Attackers often inject malware into these libraries, exploiting typosquatting or brandjacking. Developers must ensure that third-party libraries are secure and up-to-date.  \n",
            "   Securing Tax and Financial Data:  \n",
            "During tax season, enterprises are particularly vulnerable to attacks targeting financial data. Cybercriminals often use phishing tactics masquerading as tax officials to steal sensitive information. Multi-factor authentication and robust protection measures are essential for safeguarding financial data.  \n",
            "   Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks:  \n",
            "As IoT devices become more widespread, they create significant security risks due to their lack of robust security measures.

            "Text: WASHINGTON, D.C. –– The House Committee on Homeland Security has released a new “Cyber Threat Snapshot” examining growing threats posed by malign nation-states and criminal networks to the homeland and the data of Americans.\n",
            " “As China and Iran’s pre-election intrusions into campaign networks show, cyberspace is increasingly becoming the battlefield on which America’s adversaries seek to undermine our sovereignty and threaten the services that Americans depend on. The Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation of vulnerabilities in major internet service providers is just the newest alarm to sound as Beijing, Tehran, and Moscow work to gain strategic advantages through cyber espionage, manipulation, and destruction,”  Chairman Mark E. Green, MD said.  “We must remain vigilant in mitigating risks to our networks across sectors from both nation-state and opportunistic criminals, from the energy and healthcare sectors to the telecommunications infrastructure that connects us all. This Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, it’s important to remember that the public and private sectors have a vital partnership in this mission. The Committee is dedicated to fostering that collective defense when our country needs it most.”  \n",
            "    \n",
            "Since the infamous SolarWinds intrusion in 2020 and the Colonial Pipeline intrusion in 2021, malign nation-states and opportunistic cybercriminal networks have only increased their exploitation of vulnerabilities in both public and private sector networks for the purpose of ransomware, espionage, disruption, and strategic pre-positioning. Unfortunately, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure increased 30 percent globally last year.\n",
            " While our adversaries are sophisticated, one in 10 intrusions in 2023 were due to improper credentials access, with spear-phishing ranking as the second-most common attack vector for threat actors, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This reminds us that our cyber adversaries do not always need sophisticated technology to attack our networks—they merely need the right information and patience.  To undermine U.S. sovereignty, Iranian hackers used spear-phishing to target campaign networks and government officials; China allegedly backed hacking group Salt Typhoon to infiltrate candidates’ phones; and Russia used a botnet to target social media feeds in an effort to spread their malign influence.  \n",
            "The Storm-0558 intrusion into the Microsoft Exchange accounts of high-level U.S. officials and government agencies last year not only revealed the intentions of America’s adversaries, but also highlighted the importance of the public-private sector partnership. The cascading impacts of cyber insecurity are rarely ever isolated to one sector, industry, or agency. In fact, government agencies were the third-most targeted sector for ransomware attacks in 2023.\n",
            "From Iran-backed intrusions into our water sector and the targeting of satellites to the Chinese Communist Party-affiliated ‘Typhoon’ intrusions into numerous facets of our critical infrastructure, nation-states see the dangerous value in disrupting, manipulating, or surveilling the operational and information technology that supports the daily lives of Americans.\n",
            "Cyber insecurity also impacts the health and wellness of Americans, as cybercriminals increasingly target hospitals and other healthcare entities for ransom. The intrusions into the Ascension Health hospital system and Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, showcase the damage that can be done to patient care and privacy when the IT that is foundational to emergency response is undermined by cyber criminals. \n",
            "Aside from just criminal networks, nation-state actors like North Korea have also targeted the healthcare sector as a lucrative way to finance its malign activities. Tragically, one in three Americans were affected by healthcare data breaches last year. Ransomware attacks across sectors increased more than 70 percent from 2022 to 2023, according to CISA. All of these incidents must put us on high alert and remind us to be as proactive as possible in ensuring the resilience of our federal civilian and private networks from malign actors. \n",
            "To combat these threats, the Committee has advanced legislation to address the cyber workforce gap, protect our maritime ports from foreign cyber adversaries, and ensure a whole-of-government effort to combat cyber threats from China.\n",

This means we’re often not following the steps straight through but may instead jump around. For example, Processing (3) may lead us back to review our Collections (2).

            "How do we apply the CTI Intel Cycle in practical terms? Like many other analyst teams, we start our Planning by defining our Key Intel Questions (What are the key threats that we are confronting or that have the potential to impact SLTTs?) and Priority Intelligence Requirements. (Where can we find that information, and how can we enrich it to serve SLTTs?) These considerations serve as first principles, guiding our collections, analysis, and reporting to SLTT entities. For these reasons, it’s critical that they’re finely tuned and informed by SLTT feedback and input across our team.\n",
            "Case Study: Mark of the Web (MOTW) – The Intel Cycle in Action\n",
            "Once we’ve established our collections and intel requirements, it’s time to start collecting. To demonstrate this, we’ll refer to an example where our analysis eventually led to a blog post describing how threat actors were leveraging container files to evade Mark of the Web (MOTW). In the next step of the intel process, we ensure our Collections source from tailored resources, providing actionable information concerning threats most likely to impact SLTTs.\n",
            "The MOTW blog started when one of our analysts reviewed MS-ISAC internal data as part of our Processing step and identified a 173% annual spike in cyber threat actors (CTAs) leveraging container files to push malware. This sudden spike led the analyst to review the context behind the data to make sense of what was going on and determine if it signified an emerging threat tactic, technique, or procedure (TTP) likely to impact SLTTs. The analyst then dug into the context behind the data and enriched it with context from other sources.\n",
            " Analysis into the trend revealed that the tactic was an adaptation on the CTAs’ part to a recent security change by Microsoft to block macros in MS Office documents by default. The CTAs determined that leveraging container files would provide a workaround, enabling them to circumvent Microsoft’s change and continue to deliver files with embedded malicious executables.\n",
            "After reviewing further evidence and collaborating across MS-ISAC teams, the analyst refined their assessments to a degree that they were ready to produce a report on their findings. Analytic production is a critical step because the analyst consolidates their findings into a report to communicate the team’s tailored assessments and messaging to SLTTs. The actual product Dissemination takes several forms, including briefings to the SLTT community, direct peer-to-peer communication with SLTT representatives, finished intelligence reports, and other mechanisms as needed.\n",
            "Why We Do What We Do with CTI\n",
            "Ultimately, this fluid process is designed to assess threats and communicate to busy SLTT decision-makers precisely what they need to know to defend against or remediate the threat. The key components that comprise our messaging are the:\n",
            " What? What happened? What is the threat?\n",
            " So What? Why is this important to them?\n",
            " Now What? What do they need to do about it?\n",
            "Effectively communicating these points relies on our team maintaining communication with SLTTs and ensuring that our work across all five stages of the intelligence cycle is tailored to meet their needs. In this way, we help them align themselves so that they're in the best position possible to defend their networks against emerging threats.\n",

            "Text: The cybersecurity space develops methods to uncover vital information about potential threats and threat actors. One of the methods experts in the field use is cyber threat intelligence. In short, cyber threat intelligence is all the data about known threat actors and threats. The data is processed and analyzed to better understand the dangers of potential threats and the actors behind them. An important aspect of threat intelligence is understanding the threat actor’s motives, targets, and attack patterns. These are crucial aspects that security teams and experts hope to uncover and limit the damage of potential threats. In addition, threat intelligence enables cyber security teams to make better decisions regarding their cybersecurity measures and shift the approach from proactive to active. This beginner’s guide to threat intelligence will tell you everything about the new form of advanced threats. So, let’s start. What Makes Threat Intelligence Vital for Cybersecurity? The cybersecurity world is taking active measures to prevent advanced threats from achieving their goals. But advanced threat protection isn’t enough, especially when threat actors are getting bigger and bolder with their approach. The two constantly try to outmaneuver one another, and operational intelligence is vital to stop advanced threats. Simply put, it’s much easier to know how to stop cyber threats if we know their next move. That’s what threat intelligence hopes to achieve — to uncover a threat actor’s next move. Moreover, threat actors tend to focus on specific industries. Leaders of these industries can use threat intelligence to protect their businesses from ransomware, spyware, phishing, and similar malware. While basic intelligence isn’t difficult to obtain, advanced threat intelligence is the ultimate solution to integrate and protect systems and networks. The threat intelligence lifecycle begins with setting intelligence roles and operational scope and ends with a finished intelligence report on a potential threat actor along with their methods of attack, motives, and target industries. More on that later. Below are several reasons that make cyber threat intelligence one of the most vital security tools:   Uncovers new threats. The information collected on potential threats through thorough analysis has the potential to prepare your security team for new and emerging threat actors.  Uncovers a threat actor’s motives. No threat actor will target you at random. Cyber security teams say that threat actors target specific industries for specific reasons. Threat intelligence can uncover a threat actor’s motives, tactics, and techniques in hopes of stopping threats.  Uncover new ways to deal with threats. When we know the attack surface, we have better ways to deal with the threat itself. Throughout the threat intelligence lifecycle, one of the stages solely focuses on developing new detection capabilities and ways to deal with emerging attacks.  With that out the way, let’s look at the threat intelligence lifecycle. Threat Intelligence Lifecycle — Key Objectives The threat intelligence lifecycle has five stages. Let’s look at the key objective of each one.   Phase One — Planning   Threat intelligence works from the ground up. Therefore, the first stage involves planning. Planning in threat intelligence involves several tasks. Arguably, the most important task is laying out the goals for your threat intelligence. In addition, most of the tasks in this phase involve setting objectives for other phases. To better understand the first phase, remember that you’re supposed to assess which parts of your business are at risk of being targeted. Is it your employees, assets, or applications?   Phase Two — Collection   In the next phase of threat intelligence, the collection phase, experts look to collect data points on known and lesser-known threat actors. Experts will usually cast a wide net on a specific part of the internet in hopes of acquiring more information. A common ground for acquiring information on threat actors is the Dark Web. In addition, threat intelligence will also acquire malware samples in hopes of reverse-engineering the malware. That way, your tactical intelligence and incident response teams will have a better understanding of how to deal with specific malware.   Phase Three — Analysis   The analysis phase is mostly human-oriented and involves plenty of mundane tasks. These tasks are low-risk by nature. Common tasks in this phase include analyzing structural data of malware, data modeling, etc.   Phase Four — Production   The production phase looks to take all the compiled data and make it visually presentable. By that, we mean turning the data into graphical charts, dashboards, and other means of presenting complex information visually presentable. You get full creative freedom in the way you wish to present the raw data. You can present the most meaningful and essential data or do a full production report. A core pillar of phase four is recommending the appropriate course of action for each data point. You might have information regarding malware that bypasses network security, scans bad IP addresses, or targets domain names.   Phase Five — Decision   The final stage or phase of the cyber threat intelligence lifecycle is to consider everything and make a decision. This phase begins with sending the intelligence reports to the appropriate security teams and ends with a full evaluation. Next, the appropriate teams and stakeholders will come to a decision on which areas of cybersecurity to strengthen and which strategies to implement to protect systems and networks. Conclusion That concludes our beginner’s guide on cyber threat intelligence. As you can see, cyber threat intelligence is an essential process of cybersecurity that looks to uncover the unknown. Considering threat actors work in the shadows, threat intelligence will shed light and aid your cybersecurity efforts.\n",

            "Stop &amp; Shop locations have been the target of a cybersecurity attack, the company said in a press release. Parent company Ahold Delhaize issued the statement, which said they recently detected a “cybersecurity issue” within their US systems. The company notified law enforcement and began an investigation led by cybersecurity experts, the statement said. “We will continue to take actions to further protect our systems,” the statement said. “The security of our customers, associates and partners is a top priority.”  The statement said that all of Ahold Delhaize’s stores in the US remain open, despite the breach. It is unclear when the networks will be back up and running.  What is affected in the attack?  The statement was vague when defining what processes were threatened during the attack. However, the statement said the breach, and efforts to mitigate it, have affected some pharmacies and e-commerce online. It also seems that product deliveries may arrive later than expected at Stop &amp; Shop locations. A sign inside a Revere Stop &amp; Shop told customers an IT outage was affecting “behind the scenes operations,” WCVB reported.  Hannaford Supermarkets, which is also owned by Ahold Delhaize, experienced technical issues as well, saying some of their stores and pharmacies were experiencing “network issues.” The statement from Hannaford urged people who need their prescriptions to visit their local pharmacy, as the supermarket’s website was down.\n",

            " externally    Description Palo Alto Networks is aware of a claim of a remote code execution vulnerability via the PAN-OS management interface. At this time, we do not know the specifics of the claimed vulnerability. We are actively monitoring for signs of any exploitation.  We strongly recommend customers to ensure access to your management interface is configured correctly in accordance with our recommended best practice deployment guidelines. In particular, we recommend that you ensure that access to the management interface is possible only from trusted internal IPs and not from the Internet. The vast majority of firewalls already follow this Palo Alto Networks and industry best practice. Please follow links for additional information regarding ensuring the management interface best practices: How to Secure the Management Access of Your Palo Alto Networks Device: https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431  We currently believe that neither Prisma Access nor cloud NGFW would be affected. Exploitation Status We have not seen any signs of exploitation. We will keep this bulletin updated if this situation changes. Please subscribe to the RSS feed, https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/rss.xml, or email notices at https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/SupportAccount/Preferences for notifications. Solution We will develop mitigations and solutions if needed, and when we become aware of the nature and specifics of the issue. Frequently Asked Questions Q.Is there active exploitation?  No, we are not aware of any malicious exploited activity.  Q.Are there any indicators of compromise?  No, we do not have sufficient information about any indicators of compromise.

            "Text: Why We Did This Report  As part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General’s continued oversight of the EPA’s role as a sector risk management agency, passive assessment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities was conducted on drinking water systems with populations served of 50,000 people or greater. The results identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to degrade functionality, cause loss or denial of service, or facilitate the theft of customer or proprietary information.  Summary of Findings  The passive assessment covered 1,062 drinking water systems for cybersecurity vulnerabilities that serve over 193 million people across the United States. Scan results for October 8, 2024, identified 97 drinking water systems serving approximately 26.6 million users as having either critical or high-risk cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Although not rising to a level of critical or high-risk cybersecurity vulnerabilities, an additional 211 drinking water systems, servicing over 82.7 million people, were identified as medium and low by having externally visible open portals. If malicious actors exploited the cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified in this passive assessment, they could disrupt service or cause irreparable physical damage to drinking water infrastructure. While attempting to notify the EPA about the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the OIG found that the EPA does not have its own cybersecurity incident reporting system that water and wastewater systems could use to notify the EPA of cybersecurity incidents.\n",

            "Threat intelligence is information about the potential attacks an organization may face and how to detect and stop those attacks. Law enforcement sometimes distributes \"Wanted\" posters with information about suspects; similarly, cyber threat intelligence contains information about what current threats look like and where they come from.\n",
            "In digital security terms, a \"threat\" is an action with malicious intent that could result in data being stolen, lost, or altered without permission. The term refers to both potential and actual attacks. Threat intelligence enables organizations to take action against threats, rather than merely providing data. Each piece of threat intelligence helps make it possible to detect and prevent attacks.\n",
            "Some types of threat intelligence can be fed into firewalls, web application firewalls (WAFs), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and other security products, enabling them to more effectively identify and block threats. Other types of threat intelligence are more general and help organizations make larger strategic decisions.\n",
            "What are the three main types of threat intelligence?\n",
            "Most threat intelligence fits into one of these three categories:\n",
            " Strategic intelligence describes overall trends and long-term issues. It can also include the motivations, goals, and methods of known attackers.\n",
            " Operational intelligence describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used by attackers — for instance, which malware toolkits or exploit kits attackers use, where their attacks come from, or the steps they typically follow to carry out an attack.\n",
            " Tactical intelligence is specific on-the-ground details about threats; it enables organizations to identify threats on a case-by-case basis. Malware signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) are examples of tactical intelligence. Both of these terms are explained further below.\n",
            "What is a malware signature?\n",
            "A signature is a unique pattern or sequence of bytes by which malware can be identified. In the same way that fingerprints are used to identify persons suspected of a crime, signatures help identify malicious software.\n",
            "Signature detection is one of the most common forms of malware analysis. To be effective, signature detection needs to be constantly updated with the latest malware signatures identified in the wild.\n",
            "What are indicators of compromise (IoC)?\n",
            "An indicator of compromise (IoC) is a piece of data that helps identify whether or not an attack has taken place or is in progress. An IoC is like an item of physical evidence that a detective might collect to determine who was present at the scene of the crime. Similarly, certain digital evidence — unusual activity recorded in logs, network traffic to unauthorized servers, etc. — helps administrators determine when an attack has occurred (or is currently happening) and what kind of attack it was.\n",
            "Without IoCs, it can sometimes be difficult to determine if an attack has taken place; it often benefits the attacker to remain undetected (for instance, if they want to use a compromised device in a botnet).\n",
            "What is a threat intelligence feed?\n",
            "A threat intelligence feed is an external stream of threat intelligence data. Like an RSS feed for blogs, organizations can subscribe to a threat intelligence feed to provide constant security updates to their systems.\n",
            "Some threat intelligence feeds are free; others cost money and provide proprietary intelligence not available from open sources.\n",
            "What is unique about the approach Cloudflare takes to collecting threat intelligence?\n",
            "Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to collect information about threats on a huge scale. Millions of websites are protected by the Cloudflare network. By analyzing traffic to and from these websites, Cloudflare can identify malicious traffic patterns from bots, vulnerability exploits, and other attacks.\n",
            "Cloudflare uses this information to better protect customers. For example, Cloudflare creates WAF rules and deploys them for all WAF customers whenever a new threat is detected. Cloudflare Bot Management uses threat intelligence from the billions of requests Cloudflare sees each day to learn to identify malicious bots.\n",

            "Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is information describing existing or potential threats to systems and users. This intelligence takes many forms, from written reports detailing a particular threat actor's motivations, infrastructure, and techniques, to specific observations of IP addresses, domains, file hashes, and other artifacts associated with known cyber threats. CTI is used by organizations to provide essential context to unusual activity, so security personnel can quickly take action to protect their people, information, and assets. CTI can be sourced from many places, such as open-source data feeds, threat intelligence-sharing communities, commercial intelligence feeds, and local intelligence gathered in the course of security investigations within an organization.\n",
            "For SIEM solutions like Microsoft Sentinel, the most common forms of CTI are threat indicators, also known as Indicators of Compromise (IoC) or Indicators of Attack (IoA). Threat indicators are data that associate observed artifacts such as URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses with known threat activity such as phishing, botnets, or malware. This form of threat intelligence is often called tactical threat intelligence because it's applied to security products and automation in large scale to detect potential threats to an organization and protect against them. Use threat indicators in Microsoft Sentinel, to detect malicious activity observed in your environment and provide context to security investigators to inform response decisions.\n",

However, this data connector is now on a path for deprecation. We recommend new solutions to take advantage of the optimizations the upload indicators API has to offer.\n",
            "The TIP data connector works with the Microsoft Graph Security tiIndicators API. It can also be used by any custom threat intelligence platform that communicates with the tiIndicators API to send indicators to Microsoft Sentinel (and to other Microsoft security solutions like Microsoft Defender XDR).\n",

            "   Add threat indicators to Microsoft Sentinel with the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector \n",
            "The most widely adopted industry standard for the transmission of threat intelligence is a combination of the STIX data format and the TAXII protocol. If your organization obtains threat indicators from solutions that support the current STIX/TAXII version (2.0 or 2.1), use the Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector to bring your threat indicators into Microsoft Sentinel. The Threat Intelligence - TAXII data connector enables a built-in TAXII client in Microsoft Sentinel to import threat intelligence from TAXII 2.x servers.\n",

            " \n",
            "Perform two of the most common threat intelligence tasks: indicator tagging and creating new indicators related to security investigations. Create or edit the threat indicators directly within the Threat Intelligence page when you only need to quickly manage a few.\n",
            "Tagging threat indicators is an easy way to group them together to make them easier to find. Typically, you might apply tags to an indicator related to a particular incident, or representing threats from a particular known actor or well-known attack campaign. Once you search for the indicators you want to work with, tag them individually, or multi-select indicators and tag them all at once with one or more tags. Since tagging is free-form, a recommended practice is to create standard naming conventions for threat indicator tags.\n",
            "Validate your indicators and view your successfully imported threat indicators from the Microsoft Sentinel enabled log analytics workspace. The ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table under the Microsoft Sentinel schema is where all your Microsoft Sentinel threat indicators are stored. This table is the basis for threat intelligence queries performed by other Microsoft Sentinel features such as Analytics and Workbooks.\n",
            "Here is an example view of a basic query for threat indicators.\n",
            " \n",
            "TI indicators are ingested into the ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table of your log analytics workspace as read-only. Anytime an indicator is updated, a new entry in the ThreatIntelligenceIndicator table is created. Only the most current indicator is displayed in the Threat Intelligence page however. Microsoft Sentinel de-duplicates indicators based on the IndicatorId and SourceSystem properties and chooses the indicator with the newest TimeGenerated[UTC].\n",
            "The IndicatorId property is generated using the STIX indicator ID. When indicators are imported or created from non-STIX sources, the IndicatorId is generated by the Source and Pattern of the indicator.\n",

            "View GeoLocation and WhoIs data on the Threat Intelligence pane for those types of threat indicators imported into Microsoft Sentinel.\n",
            "For example, use GeoLocation data to find details like Organization or Country for an IP indicator, and WhoIs data to find data like Registrar and Record creation data from a domain indicator.\n",
            "   Detect threats with threat indicator analytics \n",
            "The most important use case for threat indicators in SIEM solutions like Microsoft Sentinel is to power analytics rules for threat detection. These indicator-based rules compare raw events from your data sources against your threat indicators to detect security threats in your organization. In Microsoft Sentinel Analytics, you create analytics rules that run on a schedule and generate security alerts. The rules are driven by queries, along with configurations that determine how often the rule should run, what kind of query results should generate security alerts and incidents, and optionally trigger an automated response.\n",
            "While you can always create new analytics rules from scratch, Microsoft Sentinel provides a set of built-in rule templates, created by Microsoft security engineers, to leverage your threat indicators. These built-in rule templates are based on the type of threat indicators (domain, email, file hash, IP address, or URL) and data source events you want to match. Each template lists the required sources needed for the rule to function. This makes it easy to determine if the necessary events are already imported in Microsoft Sentinel.\n",
            "By default, when these built-in rules are triggered, an alert will be created. In Microsoft Sentinel, the alerts generated from analytics rules also generate security incidents which can be found in Incidents under Threat Management on the Microsoft Sentinel menu. Incidents are what your security operations teams will triage and investigate to determine the appropriate response actions. Find detailed information in this Tutorial: Investigate incidents with Microsoft Sentinel.\n",
            "For more details on using threat indicators in your analytics rules, see Use threat intelligence to detect threats.\n",

            "   Workbooks provide insights about your threat intelligence \n",

Use the built-in Threat Intelligence workbook to visualize key information about your threat intelligence, and easily customize the workbook according to your business needs. Create new dashboards combining many different data sources so to visualize your data in unique ways. Since Microsoft Sentinel workbooks are based on Azure Monitor workbooks, there is already extensive documentation available, and many more templates. A great place to start is this article on how to Create interactive reports with Azure Monitor workbooks.\n",

            "Text: Tactical threat intelligence     Tactical threat intelligence is the most basic form of threat intelligence. These are your common indicators of compromise (IOCs). Tactical intelligence is often used for machine-to-machine detection of threats and for incident responders to search for specific artifacts in enterprise networks.    Using tactical threat intelligence    Tactical threat intelligence and IOCs are meant to historically document cyber attacks, serving both as a corpus of evidence (for compliance, law enforcement, investigations, legal purposes, etc.) and also as reference material for analysts to interpret and extract context for use in defensive operations. IOCs are provided to analysts to serve as examples of a particular threat, such as a malware sample, malware family, intrusion campaign, or threat actor. Analysts can enrich alerts from security solutions with tactical threat intelligence to provide more context and determine which threats are worth worrying about and which can safely be ignored.        Tactical threat intelligence for APT29        628d4f33bd604203d25dbc6a5bb35b90     2aabd78ef11926d7b562fd0d91e68ad3     3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514     meek-reflect.appspot.com     portal.sbn.co.th     202.28.231.44      hxxps://files.counseling[.]org/eFax/incoming/150721/5442.zip      googleService.exe      GoogleUpdate.exe      acrotray.exe      PCI\\VEN_80EE&amp;DEV_CAF        Tactical threat intelligence for education sector        d9b7b0eda8bd28e8934c5929834e5006     support@securitygrade[.]org     46.244.4.37            Operational threat intelligence     Operational threat intelligence provides insight into actor methodologies and exposes potential risks. It fuels more meaningful detection, incident response, and hunting programs. Where tactical threat intelligence gives analysts context on threats that are already known, operational intelligence brings investigations closer to uncovering completely new threats. This kind of intelligence is most frequently used by forensic investigators and incident responders, and typically includes the following types of items:        Tools for particular threat groups (utilities, backdoor families, common infrastructure)     Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for particular threat groups (staging directories, file naming conventions, ports, protocols, favorite file types)     Emerging TTPs (new persistence methods, exploits, phishing schemes)   Consider the following from an incident response perspective: If you are responding to an intrusion event, you may wonder how a particular actor performs privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data theft. If you are hunting for undiscovered malicious activity, you might want to start your hunt by looking for a specific actor's behavior. Whatever your scenario, you need to answer the question “How do you search for this actor within your environment?”      Using operational threat intelligence    Operational threat intelligence is knowledge gained from examining details from known attacks. An analyst can build a solid picture of actor methodology by piecing together tactical indicators and artifacts and derive them into operational intelligence. This can help to achieve a number of defensive goals, like enhancing incident response plans and mitigation techniques for future attacks and incidents. Analysts can also implement and bolster a proactive discovery program (“hunting program”) to identify suspicious files and activity that have bypassed traditional security technologies. From there they can develop detection methodologies that are not dependent on IOCs, ensuring broader coverage of threats in a more timely fashion.      Examples of operational threat intelligence       Example operational threat intelligence for APT29       Preferred Infection Vector: spear phishing with self-extracting RAR        First Stage Malware Families: COZYCAR, SWIFTKICK, TADPOLE        Second Stage Malware Families: SEADADDY, MINIDIONIS, SPIKERUSH        Persistence Techniques     Scheduled Tasks for most backdoors    WMI by manual installation for backdoors that do not have persistence built-in    Legitimate file replacement of Windows Error Reporting file (wermgr.exe)               Use of Google Docs for C2        Use of Google Cloud Apps for C2 forwarding (as a proxy)        Use of HTTP POST requests over 443 for C2        Use of backdoors configured for ports 1, 80, 443, 3389 for C2        Use of PowerShell scripts        Use of Py2Exe to modify and recompile backdoors with variance in C2 protocols and C2 infrastructure        Example operational threat intelligence for the education sector       Common attack vectors are spear phishing, watering holes, and SQL injection        Spear phishing university professors who specialize in incorporating new technology into classrooms        Spear phishing to recruiters and people involved in hiring processes        Common attacks are spear-phishing and SQL injection (SQLi)        Common malware families: PISCES, SOGU, LOGJAM, COBALT, COATHOOK, POISONIVY, NJRAT, NETWIRE        Common pentesting families: Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, Metasploit Framework            Use of HTTPS and custom TCP protocols for C2        Use of .ru, .su TLDs for C2 domains        Use of yandex.ru and bk.ru for email addresses        Theft of databases containing student names, administrative credentials, billing information, social security numbers, and other PII.             Strategic threat intelligence      Strategic threat intelligence provides a big picture look at how threats and attacks are changing over time. Strategic threat intelligence may be able to identify historical trends, motivations, or attributions as to who is behind an attack. Knowing the who and why of your adversaries also provides clues to their future operations and tactics. This makes strategic intelligence a solid starting point for deciding which defensive measures will be most effective. Strategic threat intelligence might include information on the following topic areas:      Attribution for intrusions and data breaches     Actor group trends     Targeting trends for industry sectors and geographies     Mapping cyber attacks to geopolitical conflicts and events(South China Sea, Arab Spring, Russia-Ukraine)     Global statistics on breaches, malware, and information theft     Major attacker TTP changes over time        Using strategic threat intelligence    Strategic threat intelligence is built upon a huge body of knowledge and includes expert opinions and insights that are based on aggregating both operational and tactical threat intelligence from known cyber attacks. This intelligence is particularly useful for people in leadership roles such as CISOs and executive leadership who must justify budgets and make better-informed investment decisions. Some uses of strategic threat intelligence include:     Inform your executive leadership about high-risk threat actors, relevant risk scenarios, and threat exposure in the public-facing technology sphere and criminal underground.     Perform thorough risk analysis and review of the entire technology supply chain.     Learn which commercial ventures, vendors, partner companies, and technology products are most likely to increase or decrease risk to your enterprise environment.        Examples of strategic threat intelligence       Strategic threat intelligence for APT29       APT29 is a Russia-based actor that typically engages in cyber espionage with the purpose of data theft.        APT29 victims include many global organizations in government, education, high-technology, finance, non-profit, pharma, and the Defense Industrial Base.        APT29 is an adaptable, sophisticated group with the ability to develop custom attack tools, convoluted command-and-control infrastructure, and unlike historical behaviors of Russian state-sponsored actors, this group has the audacity to continue to operate long after they have been detected.        APT29 has been historically tasked to pursue operations surrounding foreign government policy issues, especially those involving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, the group has targeted several Western national government agencies, defense and government contractors, and academic institutions.        Strategic threat intelligence for the education sector       Educational IT infrastructure has a diverse user base and is thus typically comprised of a myriad of operating systems, computer types, software, and tons of servers and websites that are publicly accessible from the internet. This makes universities and academic research facilities prime targets for attackers as both places from which to steal valuable data and also as hop points for further intrusion operations.        The education industry will continue to see cyber-espionage activity in the foreseeable future. We expect threat actors from China, Russia, Iran, and other countries to conduct espionage operations for data theft, trade information, economic intelligence, and monitoring of diaspora.        Several groups have been observed conducting intrusion operations that have affected academic institutions including universities and research centers:     APT10 aka “MenuPass Group”    APT22 aka “Barista Team”    APT29 aka “The Dukes”\n",

            "Network defenders and technology developers called upon to play their part in reducing the risk of compromise\n",
            "The UK and international allies have issued an alert today (Tuesday) showing an increase in cyber attackers initially exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks.\n",
            " In a new advisory, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – a part of GCHQ – alongside partners in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, shared a list of the top 15 routinely exploited vulnerabilities of 2023.\n",
            "Of these vulnerabilities, the majority were first exploited as zero-days – weaknesses that were recently discovered and where a fix or patch was not immediately available from the vendor – allowing attackers to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets.\n",
            "This trend, which the NCSC has continued to observe into 2024, marks a shift from 2022 when less than half of the top list was initially exploited as zero-day vulnerabilities.\n",

            "It also calls on technology vendors and developers to follow advice on implementing secure-by-design principles into their products to help reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced at source and being exploited later.\n",
            " Ollie Whitehouse, NCSC Chief Technology Officer, said:  \n",
            "“More routine initial exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities represents the new normal which should concern end-user organisations and vendors alike as malicious actors seek to infiltrate networks. \n",
            "“To reduce the risk of compromise, it is vital all organisations stay on the front foot by applying patches promptly and insisting upon secure-by-design products in the technology marketplace. \n",
            "“We urge network defenders to be vigilant with vulnerability management, have situational awareness in operations and call on product developers to make security a core component of product design and life-cycle to help stamp out this insidious game of whack-a-mole at source”.  \n",
            "All vulnerabilities listed have had patches and fixes made available from the vendors to help mitigate the risk of compromise. \n",
            "In the case of zero-day vulnerabilities, where exploitation is rife it is vital organisations have a process in place to install vendor updates at pace after they become available to minimise the opportunity for attackers.\n",
            "In addition to the top list, the advisory also details a further 32 vulnerabilities that were routinely exploited in 2023.\n",
            "If mitigation steps have not already been taken, network defenders should follow vendor advice in each case and check for indicators of compromise before applying updates.\n",
