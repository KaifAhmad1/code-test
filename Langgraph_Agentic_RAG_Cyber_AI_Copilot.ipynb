Some malware – such as IcedID and DarkGate – came up repeatedly. We also included a number of posts about the cybercrime group TA577 – who have distributed multiple malware families but here favor Pikabot. In other cases, we posted about newer malware such as JinxLoader.\n",
            "By sharing timely threat intelligence via social media channels, we report on malware infections and other threat intelligence of note in an expedited manner. These posts summarize the infection chain, offer helpful screenshots of active traffic and point towards indicators of compromise (IoCs). In 2023, our 93 timely threat intelligence posts in total generated 1.6 million-plus impressions, showing the value of getting IoCs out to the community quickly.\n",
            "This article reviews all our timely threat intelligence released from October through December 2023. Summarizing these threat intelligence posts provides an opportunity to spot trends that are less visible in single posts. We’ve included a table in the Indicators of Compromise section that lists all the posts in full by date posted, name, links to social media channels and IoCs on GitHub.\n",
            "Many of these posts contain screenshots of infection traffic filtered in Wireshark, links to the network IoCs and comments linking to packet captures (pcaps) of the associated activity, so this article also provides readers an opportunity to practice and improve their Wireshark skills.\n",
            " The IoCs shared in the social posts are all considered malicious by Palo Alto Networks products. These verdicts are used, for example, by   cloud-delivered security services   such as   Advanced WildFire   and   Advanced URL Filtering   for the   Next-Generation Firewall  .  If you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the   Unit 42 Incident Response team  . \n",
