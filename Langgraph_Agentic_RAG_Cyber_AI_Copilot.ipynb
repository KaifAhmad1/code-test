            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.   Nearly all files are digitally signed by of “Foshan Yongqiheng Trading Co., Ltd.” The metadata for each file—including copyright, product, description, internal name, and comments—reflects the name under which it was downloaded. Notably, the signing date aligns with the download date.    Other samples are signed by “Langfang Alkem Material Technology Co., Ltd.”, including those with the following hashes:   42c1550b035353ae529e98304f89bf6065647833e582d08f0228185b493d0022 8d911ef72bdb4ec5b99b7548c0c89ffc8639068834a5e2b684c9d78504550927 92d2488e401d24a4bfc1598d813bc53af5c225769efedf0c7e5e4083623f4486 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 aa25a7c2520da54ba2045a21de252632c93f8eae06e031091ab908dca4eadf45    The only file lacking a digital signature in the list shown above is 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 Regarding the tayakay[.]com domain, when a user visits the site that is embedded with tayakay[.]com JS script, it constructs a query parameter containing victim information – such as device name, IP address and others – to send to the js.php endpoint.   By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

Soon it was blocked for falling foul of the Telegram terms of service. The group stayed off the radar for several months, but as we investigated a late June 2024 attack, we found that it employed techniques identical to those of Twelve and relied on C2 servers linked to the threat actor. We are therefore confident that the group is still active and will probably soon resurface. This article uses the Unified Kill Chain methodology to analyze the attackers’ actions.\n",

            "Initial Access and Delivery\n",
            "In most of the attacks we are aware of, the adversary gained initial access to victims’ infrastructure through valid local or domain accounts, VPN or SSH certificates. After gaining access to the victim’s infrastructure, the attackers used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally.\n",
            "Most times, the attackers penetrated the target infrastructure via some of the victim’s contractors.

[The Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), developed by Lockheed Martin, details the sequential phases of a cyber attack: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. Attacker tactics and techniques can be mapped using models such as the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.\\n\\nFollowing these known strategies, after gaining unauthorized initial access, the installation phase allows the attacker to establish a foothold, and through command and control (C2), they maintain ongoing access to the compromised environment.\\n\\nDuring these middle stages InfoStealer malware often comes into play. InfoStealer malware is a type of malicious software specifically designed to extract sensitive information from an infected system. The stolen information can be leveraged to extort victims, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid, or sold on the blackmarket to other organized criminal organizations.\\u00a0 Furthermore, if the stolen information contains the victim's credentials such as username, passwords, or private keys, the attacker can use them to compromise other systems, furthering their attack.\\n\\nIn this article we will provide a comprehensive review of InfoStealer malware, what information it targets, how it operates, and list the most prolific InfoStealer malware strains. By understanding the role of InfoStealer malware organizations can better prepare and respond to the intricate landscape of cyber threats they face today.\\n\\nWhat is InfoStealer Malware?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware, as its name suggests, is a type of malicious software designed specifically to gather sensitive information from infected systems. This category of malware targets personal, financial, and business data, which can include passwords, [credit card numbers](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/pci-penetration-test/), browsing history, and other valuable information. The ultimate goal of InfoStealers is to transmit this stolen data to cybercriminals who can use it for financial gain, identity theft, or further malicious activities.\\n\\nInfoStealers often enter systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or [compromised websites](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/heres-how-you-can-defend-against-drive-by-compromise-attacks/). Once installed, they can operate quietly in the background, making them particularly hard to detect. They may also employ various techniques to avoid detection, maintain persistence, find other valuable targets on a network, and allow attackers to issue commands remotely. The most sophisticated InfoStealers are modular; they can import specific payloads after scanning the environment for potential sources of valuable information.\\n\\nHow Do InfoStealers Work?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware employs a variety of techniques to target and extract specific types of data from infected systems. Each strain of malware that is classified as a InfoStealer has different capabilities ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated modular malware. It's also important to remember that data can be stolen from a system using native built-in OS tooling known as a [Living Off The Land (LOTL)](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-living-off-the-land-attacks/) attack.\\n\\nEach method discussed below targets specific types of data or input-output peripherals. Each method also leverages unique vulnerabilities associated with how that data is used, stored, and transmitted. The diversity of these techniques underscores the necessity for comprehensive security measures that protect not just against one type of threat but a broad array of infiltration strategies.\\n\\nHere are some ways that InfoStealer malware operates:\\n\\n*   **Keylogging**: One of the most common tactics, keylogging involves recording keystrokes made by a user. By capturing everything typed, attackers can later filter out passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive personal information\\n    \\n*   **Form Grabbing**: This technique is used to intercept data submitted in forms on web pages before it is encrypted by the browser. It's particularly effective for stealing login credentials, payment information, and other data entered on websites\\n    \\n*   **Clipboard Hijacking**: InfoStealers can monitor and modify the clipboard content on an infected device. When a user copies data such as account numbers or passwords, the malware replaces or steals this information. This attack technique can even steal usernames and passwords as they are auto-filled by a [password manager](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/password-manager-breach/)\\n    \\n*   **Screen Capturing**: By taking screenshots of the user\\u2019s screen at critical moments\\u2014such as while entering credentials or viewing personal information\\u2014this method can bypass text-based data extraction limitations, capturing data displayed on the screen in any form\\n    \\n*   **Browser Session Hijacking**: This method involves stealing cookies and session tokens from a browser's cached memory which can allow cybercriminals to impersonate the victim's online session, gaining unauthorized access to online accounts without needing a username and password\\n    \\n*   **Credential Dumping**: This method extracts data from user accounts stored on the system, such as login credentials saved in web browsers or other client software. If they are stored in encrypted format, attackers will attempt to crack them offline using specialized hardware and software tools\\n    \\n*   **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: These are more sophisticated attacks where the malware injects malicious code [into the web browser itself](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/how-safe-are-your-browsers/). This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate information in real-time as it is entered on secure websites\\n    \\n*   **Email Harvesting**: The malware searches through files and emails stored on the computer to collect email addresses and other contact information, which can be used for spamming or further phishing attacks\\n    \\n*   **Crypto-Wallet Harvesting:** Some InfoStealer malware can search known installation paths for common crypto-wallet software and attempt to steal private keys. Once in the attacker's possession these keys can be used to transfer the victim's cryptocurrency to attacker controlled accounts\\n    \\n\\nThe Most Prolific Strains of InfoStealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstimating the exact number of InfoStealer malware strains is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of malware and the frequent emergence of new variants. However, cybersecurity experts and researchers generally agree that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different strains of InfoStealer malware in existence. This vast range includes everything from well-documented and widely recognized strains to more obscure or specialized ones that target specific geographic regions or sectors.\\n\\n*   [**Zeus (Zbot)**](https://www.cynet.com/malware/zeus-malware-variants-methods-and-history/)**:** Perhaps the most infamous InfoStealer, Zeus primarily targets financial information. First identified in 2007, it has been responsible for numerous cybercrimes, including banking fraud and the formation of botnets. Zeus is known for its ability to elude detection by using stealth techniques and its capability to replicate and distribute itself\\n    \\n*   [**Ursnif (Gozi)**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0386/)**:** Ursnif is another banking Trojan that has been active for over a decade. Ursnif is known for its sophisticated evasion techniques, modular design, and its ability to steal a wide variety of data types, including banking credentials and personal identifiable information (PII). Ursnif is typically spread through exploit kits and phishing emails\\n    \\n*   [**Agent Tesla**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331/)**:** Agent Tesla is a sophisticated spyware that functions primarily as a keylogger and a remote access trojan (RAT). First identified around 2014, it is capable of monitoring and collecting the victim's keyboard inputs, system clipboard, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating credentials from a variety of software installed on the victim\\u2019s machine. Agent Tesla is often distributed via malicious email attachments, disguised as legitimate files or links that execute the malware upon opening\\n    \\n*   [**LokiBot**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0447/)**:** LokiBot, first detected in 2015, is an information stealer that targets multiple platforms to steal a variety of credentials such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other data. It also has modular functionalities to download and execute additional malicious payloads giving the attacker remote access. LokiBot is typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious software installers, and compromised websites\\n    \\n*   [**TrickBot**](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/)**:** Originally identified in 2016, TrickBot has evolved from a banking trojan into a sophisticated multi-purpose malware capable of launching ransomware attacks and providing attackers with remote access to infected systems. TrickBot spreads through malspam campaigns and exploits vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. TrickBot is often considered one of the most sophisticated strains of malware with diverse capabilities\\n    \\n*   [**Raccoon Stealer**](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/ransomware-protection/raccoon-infostealer)**:** Raccoon Stealer is an information-stealing malware that emerged in 2019, known for its ease of use for low-skilled attackers, and its ability to extract a wide range of personal data. This malware steals credentials, web session cookies, and credit card data from browser caches, and searches for cryptocurrency wallets to extract private keys. Raccoon Stealer spreads via malicious email campaigns and exploit kits, leveraging its simplicity and effectiveness to appeal to a wide range of cybercriminals, including those with limited technical expertise\\n    \\n*   [**Redline Stealer**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/07/threat-thursday-redline-infostealer)**:** Redline Stealer, first observed in 2020, is a relatively new but rapidly popular malware designed to steal passwords, credit card information, and other sensitive data stored in web browsers. It can also collect details about the infected system\\u2019s environment in order to facilitate secondary attacks such as privilege escalation and maintaining persistence. Redline Stealer is typically distributed through phishing campaigns, malicious advertisements, and bundled with cracked software, highlighting the risks of downloading unverified software from the internet\\n    \\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nInfoStealers represents a distinct type of malware, adept at extracting sensitive information from compromised systems, and plays a crucial role during the middle stages of a cyber attack\\u2014post-initial access. It targets a wide range of data, from personal and financial information to credentials that facilitate lateral movements within networks or enable extortion schemes.\\u00a0 Understanding the nature and function of InfoStealer malware is essential for organizations seeking to enhance their defensive strategies against an increasingly sophisticated array of cyber threats.\\n\\nLooking for more deep-dives on topics related to InfoStealer malware and other cybersecurity news?

past seven years, Flashpoint has observed a significant rise in the use of infostealer malware. Their simplicity, vast availability, and low costs have made them extremely popular among [threat actors](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/threat-actor/), making infostealers an increasingly primary vector for [ransomware](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/ransomware/) and other high-impact [data breaches](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/data-breach/). Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to protect themselves against this growing threat. In this blog, we explain the risks posed by infostealer malware and outline the essential steps security teams can take to ensure the integrity of sensitive data.\\n\\n![Image 75: Thumbnail of - Evolution & Riseof Stealer Malware](https://flashpoint.io/wp-content/uploads/stealer-small-image.png)\\n\\n**The Evolution and Rise of Stealer Malware**\\n\\nLearn what stealers are, how they work, and what malicious actors are doing with compromised data.\\n\\n[Read Now](https://flashpoint.io/blog/evolution-stealer-malware/)\\n\\nUnderstanding Infostealer Malware\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealers are a type of malware designed specifically to harvest sensitive information, such as login credentials (commonly referred to as \\u201clogs\\u201d) from infected systems. Logs are incredibly valuable for threat actors\\u2014especially those related to third-party software-as-a-service applications such as Salesforce, Slack or Microsoft Office 365\\u2014since compromised credentials can allow them to infiltrate and move laterally within systems.\\n\\n[![Image 76: Flashpoint's Cyber Threat Intelligence Index: Infostealer Infographic](https://flashpoint.io/wp-content/uploads/Infostealer_Quickview_2024_Midyear-1024x576.png)](https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/2024-cyber-threat-intelligence-index/)\\n\\nThe Infostealer Lifecycle and TTPs\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nEven one compromised credential can result in a data breach or cyberattack. For example, in January 2024, a major European telecommunications company suffered a massive network outage that impacted around half of its network\\u2019s traffic. The root cause was traced to a single weak password that was exposed by infostealer malware.\\n\\n### The Infostealer Lifecycle\\n\\n1.  **Infection:** Information-stealing malware was used to expose login credentials, including a weak password which was sold on underground markets.\\n2.  **Exposure:** Sold credentials included access to the IP network coordination center (RIPE) account and a critical database containing IP addresses and their owners in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.\\n3.  **Infiltration and escalation:** The threat actor(s) that purchased these credentials leveraged the weak password to log in to the organization\\u2019s RIPE account and initiated further malicious activities. MFA or 2FA was not enabled on the compromised account.\\n4.  **Attack:** Malicious actors caused a massive network outage which impacted around half of its network traffic.\\n\\n### Infostealer TTPs\\n\\nDepending on the [strain of infostealer](https://flashpoint.io/blog/understanding-seidr-infostealer-malware/), threat actors can adapt their TTPs to bypass security measures, making it imperative for organizations to implement comprehensive defenses. The following tags from MITRE ATT&CK helps define the usual TTPs affiliated with information-stealing malware:\\n\\n*   **Valid Accounts (T1078):** Obtained through information stealer logs, either in Telegram channels, subscription services, or venues like Russian Market.\\n*   **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059):** Executes commands to deploy the malware.\\n*   **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027):** Avoids detection through obfuscation techniques.\\n*   **Credentials from Password Stores (T1555):** The information-stealing malware extracts passwords from stores.\\n*   **Query Registry (T1012):** The information-stealing malware gathers additional system and user information.\\u00a0\\n*   **Data from Information Repositories (T1213):** The attacker collects data from various information repositories.\\u00a0\\n*   **Exfiltration Over Web Service (T1567):** The data is exfiltrated to an external web server controlled by the attacker.\\n*   **Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486):** The exfiltrated data is encrypted or compressed before exfiltration.\\n\\nProtecting Against Infostealer Malware\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n### Step 1: Implement Targeted Security Measures\\n\\nOne of the most effective ways to protect against infostealers is to ensure that specific, targeted security measures are in place. This is even more important as organizations increasingly rely on third-party services and platforms. The following best practices will significantly mitigate risk posed by infostealers:\\n\\n1.  **Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication**:  \\n    Adds an extra layer of security, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access.\\n2.  **Rotate or update credentials:**Regularly changing passwords limits the opportunity for attackers to exploit stolen credentials.\\n3.  **Install network access controls:**  \\n    Only allow access from trusted locations or specific IP ranges.\\n4.  **Monitor for the use of compromised session cookies:**  \\n    Deploy monitoring tools and educate employees on the importance of logging out from sessions and clearing browser cookies.\\n5.  **Monitor third-parties or contractors:  \\n    **Regularly review and audit access permissions. Ensure that contractors are beholden to the same security standards and conduct regular security assessments.\\n\\nWhile many of these best practices are well established and generally implemented, security teams must remember that compliance is only the first step. For example, some systems and software may not require MFA or prompt users to update passwords. However, it is critical that organizations mandate the use of MFA or 2FA and routinely update credentials. Even though these steps are basic, threat actors often infiltrate victim systems by exploiting these gaps, [even in larger organizations](https://flashpoint.io/blog/protecting-against-infostealer-malware/#infostealer-lifecycle-ttps).\\n\\n### Step 2: Monitor for Stolen Logs\\n\\nAfter ensuring that foundational protections are in place, organizations looking to protect against infostealer malware need to monitor illicit marketplaces for any stolen logs that are alleged to stem from your organization or associated third parties. However, without a comprehensive source of [threat intelligence](https://flashpoint.io/ignite/cyber-threat-intelligence/), doing so will be a major challenge\\u2014as there are tens of thousands of Telegram channels, subscription log services, and log shops.\\n\\n**Flashpoint has observed multiple instances of malicious actors attempting to gain access to organizations via the following domains:**\\n\\n*   1password.com\\n*   atlassian.net\\n*   greenhouse.io\\n*   okta.com\\n*   salesforce.com\\n*   service-now.com\\n*   sharepoint.com\\n*   slack.com\\n*   splunkcloud.com\\n*   zendesk.com\\n*   zoom.us\\n\\nUsing Flashpoint, organizations can inventory their infrastructure and share any internal domains with our analysts. Doing so creates custom alerts that [notifies security teams](https://flashpoint.io/ignite/brand-intelligence/) of any potential incidents leveraging [Flashpoint\\u2019s massive collections](https://flashpoint.io/platform/).\\n\\n### Step 3: Proactively Acquire Logs and Remove Them from Illicit Marketplaces\\n\\nIn addition to monitoring, organizations may want to consider proactively acquiring logs themselves and removing them from illicit marketplaces. Using [Flashpoint\\u2019s Requests for Information (RFI) service](https://flashpoint.io/resources/datasheets/request-for-information-datasheet/), organizations can request our intelligence analysts to acquire the listing on their behalf and take precautions to remove it from log shops.\\n\\n![Image 77: Stolen Log 3 picture](https://flashpoint.io/wp-content/uploads/stolen-log-3-1024x628.png.webp)\\n\\nAn example of a stolen log advertised on an illicit market. (Source: Flashpoint)\\n\\n### Step 4: Leverage Insights to Stay Ahead of Potential Threats\\n\\nUltimately, organizations need to stay informed about emerging infostealer trends and techniques. New variations of infostealers are constantly being advertised on illicit marketplaces and each variant improves its ability to bypass defensive measures.\\n\\nLeveraging a comprehensive source of [threat intelligence](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/threat-intelligence/) like [Flashpoint Ignite](https://flashpoint.io/ignite/) provides security teams with unparalleled visibility into the threat landscape. Through a single easy-to-use platform, organizations gain insight into the deep and dark web, [open source intelligence](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/open-source-intelligence/), [vulnerabilities](https://flashpoint.io/intelligence-101/vulnerability/), and breach data. Armed with Flashpoint\\u2019s massive collections and finished intelligence reports, security teams can stay ahead of potential threats.\\n\\nProtect Yourself Against Infostealer Malware Using Flashpoint\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware poses significant risks to organizations, but with the right security measures informed by the best data and intelligence, these risks can be mitigated.

The browser fingerprint can be used to impersonate the victim and access the victim&#x27;s bank accounts, take over accounts, and make fraudulent purchases.\", \"content\": \"Summary\\n-------\\n\\nSecureworks\\u00ae Counter Threat Unit\\u2122 (CTU) researchers have observed infostealers (also known as stealers) playing an increasingly important role in the cybercrime ecosystem. This type of malware can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data from compromised computers and networks. Infostealers can be installed on a computer or device via phishing attacks, infected websites, and malicious software downloads. Once installed, they can execute and exit very quickly; many infostealers finish collecting and transmitting stolen data within several seconds to a minute of total runtime. The data is then packaged and sold as logs. Threat actors could use stolen credentials in these logs to gain unauthorized access to enterprise networks via remote access services such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA). This unauthorized access can result in the exfiltration of sensitive data or the deployment of ransomware, which can cause significant financial loss and reputational damage. Although the name 'infostealer' implies data theft, this malware has evolved over time to include deployment of additional tools and malware.\\n\\nUnderground forums and marketplaces\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealers are often sold as a monthly subscription service. The price can range from $50 to over $1,000 USD per month for access to a stealer command and control (C2) server operated by the developer. The service often features a range of support functions, including multiple ways to view, download, and share stolen data. Self-hosted stealer C2 servers are also available and are usually sold for a flat fee.\\n\\nUnderground forums provide a shared space for threat actors to discuss ongoing projects, request new features, and provide malware reviews. They also offer a marketplace to advertise new and existing stealers. Underground forums such as XSS . is and exploit . in are popular with threat actors involved in the development and deployment of infostealers.\\n\\nThese forums consist of subforums and sections that host a range of topics. They also contain administrative areas to control announcements, sales, and memberships. Many underground forums have a dedicated marketplace and enforce stringent rules to sell illegal products such as infostealers. Larger, high-profile forums offer an escrow service to mediate transactions between vendors and customers, building trust in the marketplace and providing a degree of control over interactions.\\n\\nStealer logs are available from underground forums, marketplaces, and other online platforms that cater to threat actors interested in obtaining credentials, financial information, personal data, banking details, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive, secret, or valuable information. These marketplaces are often only accessible through Tor or the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) anonymity services and usually have strict rules and regulations regarding the types of information that can be traded. The offerings are typically only accessible to members who have been approved by the marketplace's administrators or who pay an entry fee. Some marketplaces only sell infostealer logs and have built their infrastructure to facilitate these transactions. Other forums offer many illicit wares for sale and have sections that include logs obtained from infostealers.\\n\\nA burgeoning market also exists for after-action tools. Infostealers can lower the bar for entry to cybercrime, but the uninitiated can find the logs to be challenging to parse. Multiple vendors sell tools to assist in log parsing, enabling cybercriminals to extract data of interest from the raw logs.\\n\\n### Russian Market\\n\\nRussian Market is by far the biggest underground marketplace for infostealer logs, and it has ties to the now-defunct Amigos Marketplace. As of this publication, Russian Market offers over five million logs for sale, which is roughly ten times more than its nearest rival. Historically, the marketplace predominantly sold logs obtained through five infostealers: RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, Taurus, and AZORult. As of late February 2023, it stopped carrying Taurus and AZORult logs. Since December 2022, researchers observed [RisePRO](https://flashpoint.io/blog/risepro-stealer-and-pay-per-install-malware-privateloader/) infostealer logs for sale through the marketplace, although total offerings remain low. Table 1 lists the number of infostealer logs for sale on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023.\\n\\nStealer\\n\\nNumber of available logs\\n\\nRaccoon\\n\\n2,114,549\\n\\nVidar\\n\\n1,816,800\\n\\nRedLine\\n\\n1,415,458\\n\\nRisePRO\\n\\n3,833\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n5,350,640\\n\\n_Table 1. Number of infostealer logs available for purchase on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023._\\n\\nIn October 2022, Russian Market changed its operating model to allow users to preorder credentials (see Figure 1). This feature requires that buyers deposit $1,000 USD into the site's escrow system. Buyers can then request credentials based on a domain name (from a specific organization) or a 'mask' (from a specific application). Although there are no guarantees that preorders will be fulfilled, this feature could lead to specific targeting of organizations and sectors rather than relying just on opportunistic attacks.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-01.png)  \\n_Figure 1. Russian Market interface for preorder logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Genesis Market\\n\\nGenesis Market is an invitation-only marketplace that specializes in the sale of bots rather than logs. Bots are computers that were infected with infostealer malware to steal information and the browser fingerprint from a victim's web browser. The browser fingerprint can be used to impersonate the victim and access the victim's bank accounts, take over accounts, and make fraudulent purchases. A threat actor who purchases a bot has exclusive access to the data, including updates of the victim's data from the infected device.\\n\\nGenesis Market provides a custom browser plugin to customers and distinguishes itself among the competition by including more automation for site users. These features effectively render the bots as logs, removing the need to manually parse details and lowering the technical bar to entry. As of February 2023, Genesis Market listed over 450,000 bots from nearly every country (see Figure 2).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-02.png)  \\n_Figure 2. Number of available bots for sale on Genesis Market as of February 2023. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nOn April 4, 2023, Genesis Market was the target of a coordinated international [law enforcement action](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) led by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite the arrests of multiple users and the takedown of 11 domains, Operation Cookie Monster did not completely shutter the marketplace. As of this publication, the Tor version of Genesis Market remains operational. Logs have been added for sale since the takedown, albeit at a slower rate than usual.\\n\\n### 2easy\\n\\nThe 2easy marketplace has rapidly grown since it was established in 2018. Like Genesis Market, 2easy is automated, allowing buyers to add money to wallets and purchase logs without directly interacting with the seller. Unlike other sites, 2easy does not provide samples or previews. However, logs are [reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/2easy-now-a-significant-dark-web-marketplace-for-stolen-data/) less expensive than those on Genesis Market and Russian Market.\\n\\nThreat actors who purchase logs through the 2easy marketplace receive an archive file from the selected bot. The file's content depends on the stealer and its unique capabilities. RedLine has historically been the favorite infostealer for threat actors selling logs through 2easy, but the marketplace also sells Raccoon, Vidar, and AZORult logs. As of February 2023, 2easy offered over 750,000 logs for sale (see Figure 3).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-03.png)  \\n_Figure 3. Logs for sale on the 2easy marketplace. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nTelegram\\n--------\\n\\nAs demonstrated by the April 2023 Genesis Market takedown, one of the risks to sellers using traditional forums and marketplaces is the threat of law enforcement action. Another example was RaidForums, which was established in 2015 and became one of the most popular criminal marketplaces offering credentials and infostealers. In 2022, a coordinated international law enforcement investigation dubbed [Operation TOURNIQUET](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-hacker-forums-taken-down) resulted in the seizure of three domains and the arrest of RaidForums's founder and chief administrator. In addition, several cybercrime forums were [breached](https://www.securityweek.com/someone-hacking-cybercrime-forums-and-leaking-user-data/) in 2021 and their user data was stolen and either leaked or sold online. These takedowns and breaches undermine the security and integrity of the platforms and can degrade sellers' confidence in the anonymity offered by the forums. As a result, many cybercriminals use the Telegram messaging platform to advertise their services.\\n\\nTelegram is a multi-platform messaging service that has an estimated [700 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/234038/telegram-messenger-mau-users/) monthly users. Benefits of this platform for cybercriminals include its focus on privacy, encryption, and an open-source application programming interface (API) that allows 'unofficial clients' (alternative messaging apps that use Telegram's API) to communicate with the official app and web interface. The end-to-end encryption and support for private and anonymous channels are ideal for selling and trading stolen data and information. Telegram users can subscribe to channels on which owners can post content, or they can become members of groups and participate in discussions. Cybercriminals use these channels and groups to sell infostealers such as [Titan Stealer](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/titan-stealer-telegram-malware-campaign). Some channels are hidden and require specific invitations or permissions to access. There has [reportedly](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/positive-technologies-cybercrime-market-in-telegram-is-growing/) been a significant increase in the use of Telegram to sell illicit goods and services. Over 120,000 messages were published across more than 300 Telegram public channels and groups between the beginning of 2019 and the second quarter of 2022. RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan, Oski Stealer, and Loki Stealer are prominently represented on Telegram. [RaccoonV2](https://www.esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-raccoon-stealer-v2-0) operators extensively use Telegram for announcements, business discussions, and reporting stolen data.\\n\\nDespite the simplicity of selling goods over Telegram, it remains more popular for selling illicit goods such as drugs rather than for selling malware due to its primary function as a messaging platform. This limitation makes it difficult for sellers to migrate from traditional underground forums and marketplaces that feature advanced search capabilities and a way for sellers to build reputation, which is important when establishing trust with buyers. CTU\\u2122 researchers have observed scammers on Telegram mimicking real threat actors by creating fake profiles based on listings from forums such as Breached. This lack of reputation status and the prevalence of scammers is likely to undermine trust, preventing threat actors from fully adopting Telegram.\\n\\nInfostealer variants\\n--------------------\\n\\nInfostealers rose to prominence in 2006 with the [ZeuS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/zeus) trojan, which targeted online banking credentials. After the ZeuS source code was [leaked](https://www.theregister.com/2011/03/23/zeus_source_code_sale/) in March 2011, the creation of multiple variants boosted the popularity of this type of malware and inspired the development of infostealers with increasingly sophisticated capabilities. Some infostealers can be tailored or customized for specific targets and goals. For example, [LokiBot](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-266a) has been prominent since 2016 and was one of the first infostealers that targeted the Android operating system. The [Ducktail](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-php-variant-ducktail-infostealer-targeting-facebook-business-accounts) infostealer was first observed in 2022 and specifically targeted Facebook business accounts. Infostealers such as [BHUNT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bhunt-malware-targets-your-crypto-wallets-and-passwords/) specialize in stealing cryptocurrency, while state-sponsored threat groups such as [IRON TILDEN](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/iron-tilden) use custom versions to conduct espionage.\\n\\nCTU researchers analyzed the Russian Market marketplace to understand each infostealer's properties and capabilities. The table in the [Appendix](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-growing-threat-from-infostealers#appendix) compares features of the most common infostealers in 2022 but may not be a comprehensive view. Much of the information related to targeted browser extensions and applications is only found through the infostealer configurations. These configurations specify what information to extract from a compromised system, but they frequently change.\\n\\n### RedLine\\n\\nRedLine emerged in March 2020, and its logs are the best seller on Russian Market. RedLine is sold standalone or as a subscription. As of March 2023, standalone copies (the 'PRO' version) were advertised on Telegram for $900 USD, with subscriptions available for $150 per month or $400 for three months (see Figure 4). This malware steals information from web browsers, including saved credentials, autocomplete data, credit card information, and cryptocurrency wallets. While running on an infected system, RedLine takes a system inventory of the username, location data, hardware configuration, and installed security software.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-04.png)  \\n_Figure 4. RedLine Telegram channel listing prices and deals. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRedLine is distributed via [cracked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking) games, applications, and services, as well as via phishing campaigns and malicious ads. CTU researchers have observed multiple instances of threat actors using malicious Microsoft OneNote files to deliver RedLine. RedLine has also been observed using YouTube for [self-propagation](https://securelist.com/self-spreading-stealer-attacks-gamers-via-youtube/107407/) and has been linked by CTU researchers to SM Viewbot malware. SM Viewbot promotes YouTube videos to lure users who are searching for cracked software. Victims who download installers advertised in the video descriptions may infect their systems with infostealers.\\n\\nRedLine's execution process is straightforward. Once executed, the malware decodes XOR-encoded data such as the C2 server IP address and a unique ID. After the decoding process, RedLine requests configuration data from the C2 server, which instructs RedLine on what information to collect from the compromised system. Information related to the configuration data is then collected from the compromised system, converted into XML format, and transmitted to the C2 server via a Simple Object Access Protocol ([SOAP](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_soap.asp)) message.\\n\\n### Raccoon\\n\\nThe original Raccoon Stealer emerged in 2019. It operated as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model and was advertised on underground forums. The cost was $75 USD per week or $200 per month. It did not include a distribution mechanism, so customers had to devise a method to install the infostealer on compromised systems. The Raccoon Stealer panel was hosted on a Tor site.\\n\\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the threat actors responsible for Raccoon Stealer announced that they were [shutting down](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/raccoon-stealer-malware-suspends-operations-due-to-war-in-ukraine/) their operations, implying that a group member had died. However, the threat actors released a new version of the malware named RaccoonV2 in May 2022 (see Figure 5). While Raccoon Stealer and RaccoonV2 share similar functionality, CTU analysis confirms that RaccoonV2 represents a significant rewrite of the malware.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-05.png)  \\n_Figure 5. Raccoon Stealer Telegram channel giving details of the new build. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRaccoonV2 remains under active development as of this publication. The developers encoded more of the code strings in later versions and changed the encoding method, moving from Base64 to XOR. They continually alter elements of the malware to improve defense evasion, including changes to the User-Agents and mutexes, presumably to circumvent indicator-based detections. To hinder static and dynamic analysis, updates included intermixing chunks of code with thousands of bytes of opcodes from superfluous Windows API function calls.\\n\\nThe RaccoonV2 infostealer obtains its configuration file from a hard-coded C2 server. This file specifies what data the malware should steal (e.g., password files, credit card information, web browser data, email messages, cryptocurrency wallets, browser cookies). This data is stored as individual files in the %APPDATA%\\\\\\\\LocalLow directory before it is sent to the malware C2 server via an HTTP POST request.\\n\\nRaccoonV2 has occasionally been deployed alongside other infostealers such as RedLine. It has been [observed](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/464621/0/html) downloading and executing malware such as SmokeLoader, cryptocurrency wallet hijackers, Amadey, Remcos, AZORult, Allcome Clipper, SystemBC, and cryptocurrency miners.\\n\\n### Vidar\\n\\nVidar primarily operates as an infostealer but has also been used to deploy ransomware. The malware was first observed in 2019 during a prolific malvertising [campaign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/01/vidar-gandcrab-stealer-and-ransomware-combo-observed-in-the-wild) where threat actors used the Fallout exploit kit to distribute Vidar and GandCrab as secondary payloads. Vidar is sold on underground forums and Telegram channels (see Figure 6) as a standalone product, usually for between $130 USD per week to $750 for three months. Vidar provides an admin panel that lets customers configure the malware and monitor infections (see Figure 7).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-06.png)  \\n_Figure 6. Vidar Telegram channel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-07.png)  \\n_Figure 7. Vidar infostealer admin panel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nVidar is a Windows-based stealer that is written in C++ and based on the Arkei stealer. It steals system data such as machine ID, operating system, computer name, display resolution, keyboard language, hardware information, network information, and a list of installed software. Vidar can extract browser artifacts, the contents of some cryptocurrency wallets, PayPal data, session data, and screenshots.\\n\\nIn addition to stealing sensitive data, Vidar can deliver secondary payloads such as the SystemBC proxy malware. Because Vidar is available to any paying threat actor, the delivery method varies and may include phishing emails or pirated software.\\n\\nIn early 2022, CTU researchers observed Vidar creating profiles on the Mastodon social networking platform to obtain and post C2 IP addresses. The Mastodon sites used by Vidar have thousands of members, and it is unlikely that the threat actors manage or control the infrastructure. Vidar verifies that the compromised system is not located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by checking the computer language and keyboard settings. It then contacts the C2 server, which responds with the malware configuration. Vidar exfiltrates host and system information from infected devices and sends the data to the C2 server via HTTP form data POST requests.\\n\\n### Taurus\\n\\nThe 'Taurus Project,' as the infostealer was named by its developers, was first observed in the second quarter of 2020. It is the fourth-most prolific stealer on Russian Market, even though it has been inactive since late 2021. Taurus was primarily advertised on Russian-language forums and will not execute within CIS countries. There are [indications](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/threat-intelligence-report-project-taurus-infostealer-follows-in-predator-the-thiefs-footprints.pdf) that the group responsible for this malware was also responsible for the 'Predator the Thief' infostealer, either directly or through the sale of the original software to a third party. Taurus can steal VPN credentials, social media details, cryptocurrency credentials; take screenshots of the victim's desktop; and exfiltrate the system's software installation and configuration information. This data can be used to further exploit the compromised system. Taurus includes a dashboard that lets threat actors monitor infections by geographic region and customize the malware configuration to specify targeted information.\\n\\nTaurus was predominantly distributed via spam emails containing a malicious attachment. Opening the attached document prompts the victim to enable macros, which then executes a PowerShell script that initiates the download of additional payloads. Stolen data is exfiltrated as a ZIP file to a C2 server whose URL is built at runtime. Figure 8 shows the infection process.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-08.png)  \\n_Figure 8. Infection process for the Taurus infostealer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Rhadamanthys\\n\\nThe Rhadamanthys infostealer was first observed in the third quarter of 2022. It quickly established its reputation on underground forums due to the active development and deployment of user-friendly features that align with market demands. Rhadamanthys targets a wide range of applications, wallets, and user data on an infected device. The developers appear receptive to suggestions for regular updates and enhancements (see Figure 9). Rhadamanthys operates using a MaaS model and has been observed using phishing emails and Google Ads as the initial infection vector.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-09.png)  \\n_Figure 9. Forum post announcing Rhadamanthys updates. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nCTU researchers observed a threat actor named \\\"kingcrete2022\\\" advertising Rhadamanthys in September 2022 for $250 USD for 30 days or $550 for 90 days, payable in Monero or Bitcoin. In November 2022, a threat actor named 'Kingcrete' uploaded [two videos](https://vimeo.com/user185512701) to Vimeo. One video was an overview of the 'v0.3.2 updates.' The second video was named 'Wallter Crack and Customized Dictionaries' and showed how the infostealer targets cryptocurrency wallets. Both videos show details of the Rhadamanthys admin panel and a walkthrough of how it is used.\\n\\nRhadamanthys is written in C++. It evades detection by operating in system memory and by creating a mutex to ensure that only one instance is running. It uses the Al-Khaser anti-analysis tool to detect and avoid running in researcher sandboxes and virtual machines (VMs). Rhadamanthys is custom-packed with several stages that include dropping a custom loader DLL that decodes and executes an encoded payload via a command-line argument. The custom loader executes shellcode in a novel way by abusing the callback mechanism of the Windows CryptEnumOIDInfo() function and masquerades as a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer running the PrintUIEntry export (see Figure 10).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-10.png)  \\n_Figure 10. Example of Rhadamanthys masquerading as an NSIS installer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRhadamanthys decodes the C2 URL used for initial communication using a generated 128-byte XOR key. The configuration file it receives from the C2 server is disguised as a JFIF image via [steganography](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/01/12/rhadamanthys-new-stealer-spreading-through-google-ads/). The infostealer uses the [WebSocket](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2023/01/03/index.html) protocol to encrypt post-infection traffic, which includes stolen and exfiltrated data. Rhadamanthys can also be configured to run arbitrary executables.\\n\\n### State-sponsored stealers\\n\\nInfostealers are not exclusively used by cybercriminals. Because infostealers can discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, they are commonly and effectively used by state-sponsored threat groups that focus on cyberespionage operations. During the conflict in Ukraine, Russian threat actors deployed the [Graphiron](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/new-infostealer-discovered-russia/) infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. This infostealer is similar to the [GraphSteel](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/spear-phish-ukrainian-entities) malware previously used against Ukraine but includes enhanced capabilities. Graphiron is Go-based malware that can steal system and application data, screenshots, account credentials, and private keys. It consists of a downloader and a secondary information-stealing payload. The downloader checks for various security software and malware analysis tools before downloading the payload. Graphiron uses AES encryption with hard-coded keys to communicate with the C2 server through port 443.\\n\\nChinese state-sponsored threat groups have also been observed using infostealers in pursuit of their objectives. Reports of a 2022 espionage campaign targeting various government and public entities in Asia identified a custom [Infostealer.Logdatter](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/espionage-asia-governments) infostealer that logged keystrokes, captured screenshots, stole clipboard data, downloaded files, injected code, and both connected to and queried SQL databases. This campaign has been attributed to the [BRONZE ATLAS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-atlas) threat group.\\n\\nThe infostealer ecosystem\\n-------------------------\\n\\nMuch like the general cybercriminal ecosystem, the successful development and deployment of infostealers relies on individuals with a broad range of skills, roles, and responsibilities. These individuals include developers, initial access brokers (IABs), and customers (see Figure 11). The rise of MaaS operations has lowered the technical barrier to entry into cybercrime. It has also fostered innovation among developers as they improve their products and appeal to a broad audience of potential customers on underground forums and marketplaces.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-11.png)  \\n_Figure 11. An overview of roles and relationships in the infostealer ecosystem. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Developers\\n\\nMalware developers are responsible for writing and maintaining the code that will be packaged and sold on underground forums, typically to IABs. With MaaS being the most common business model in the infostealer marketplace, developers can dedicate more time and effort to ensuring their malware contains a range of features, taking feedback from users, and iterating the malware to constantly evolve and improve. Forums allow customers to leave feedback, enhancing the seller's reputation and potentially increasing the popularity of the malware.\\n\\n### Initial access brokers\\n\\nIABs are individuals or groups that rent access to tools from MaaS operators on underground forums and marketplaces. They then deploy these infostealers via phishing or malicious ad campaigns to infect systems. These infostealers steal data from the compromised system and exfiltrate it to a C2 server. This stolen data, typically including credentials for services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), VPNs, email accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets, is then sold to threat actors who use it for malicious purposes.\\n\\n### Customers\\n\\nDue to diverse types of data that infostealers can obtain from a compromised system, threat actors often purchase the data for a wide range of purposes. Financially motivated cybercriminals may purchase credentials for cryptocurrency wallets, online banking, or other financial services and abuse them to make fraudulent withdrawals or transactions. Ransomware groups commonly seek infostealer logs, as credentials for RDP, VPNs, and corporate accounts can provide initial access into enterprises prior to data exfiltration and encryption. The value of infostealers to ransomware groups has increased with the success of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and the growth of 'hack-and-leak' sites. For example, the LockBit ransomware operators [reportedly](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1587887149411536896) offered to purchase the Raccoon Stealer source code.\\n\\n### Specialist log parsers\\n\\nLog marketplaces such as Genesis Market have built-in parsing as a browser extension, which allows customers to seamlessly access device fingerprints and victim data. Other marketplaces like Russian Market and 2easy sell raw logs that require parsing to interpret and use the content. Parsing infostealer logs purchased from a underground marketplace can be a complex task, as the logs are often in various formats and contain a large amount of data. This challenge has created a secondary market for individuals selling parser tools to customers who have either deployed the infostealers and want to sell structured data or to buyers in possession of bulk raw logs (see Figures 12 and 13).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-12.png)  \\n_Figure 12.

(Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn 2022, stolen credentials [featured heavily](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-irs-learning-from-incident-response-team-2022-year-in-review) in Secureworks incident response engagements. Infostealer malware poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations. Its ability to steal sensitive information such as passwords and financial information has far-reaching consequences for victims. This type of malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult for victims to detect and remove. Additionally, the evolution of criminal marketplaces allows relatively low-skilled threat actors to access tools with advanced capabilities to attack many victims.\\n\\nThe migration to remote work driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and sustained post-pandemic exposes users and organizations to even greater risk from infostealers. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies that let users access corporate assets from infected personal devices can lead to compromises of corporate systems.\\n\\nTo mitigate this threat, individuals and organizations must take proactive steps to secure their systems. These steps include keeping software up to date, using strong and unique passwords that must not be stored in web browsers, and being wary of suspicious emails or downloads. It is also crucial to invest in security solutions that can detect and block infostealer malware. By taking these actions, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of compromise.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\nAbrams, Lawrence. \\u201cRaccoon Stealer malware suspends operations due to war in Ukraine.\\u201d Bleeping Computer.

See which stealers dominate the market\", \"content\": \"The Cybercrime world changes rapidly \\u2013 both by expanding, collapsing, and evolving extensively and intensively. One of the most massive malware types in the modern threat landscape \\u2013 **Infostealer Malware** \\u2013 appears to enter a new stage of development. Though its major names remain the same, some new malware families with promising features popped out. Let\\u2019s have a peek at all of them and see what to expect.\\n\\n[Infostealer Malware Market in 2024](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-in-2024)[Infostealer Malware Market Leaders](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-leaders)[RedLine Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#redline-infostealer)[Raccoon Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#raccoon-infostealer)[Vidar Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#vidar-infostealer)[Newbies](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#newbies)[Lumma](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#lumma)[Stealc](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#stealc)[How to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#how-to-protect-against-infostealer-malware)\\n\\nInfostealer malware gained more and more popularity during the last decade. However, the biggest spike happened during the last few years. The first noticeable factor is the massive popularisation of cryptocurrencies. How is that related? Well, relatively big amounts of money always attracted the attention of hackers. Carding and banking fraud though is now less effective as banks implemented strict controlling measures back in the early \\u201810s. Cryptocurrency wallets, on the other hand, have low to no control, making them ideal targets for Infostealer.\\n\\n![Image 1: Infostealer Malware stats](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stealer-activity-2022.webp)\\n\\nAnother reason that made spyware and infostealers so popular and widespread is **their massive application in attacks on corporations**. Even when hackers break into the network to cipher the files and ask for a ransom for their decryption, they also drop an Infostealer malware that will exfiltrate as much valuable information as possible. Afterwards, [hackers request an additional ransom](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/top-famous-ransomware-groups-2022/) to keep this data secret. Some attacks are based exclusively on stealers, and the result of their job is both sold on the Darknet or used for business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Additionally, some ransomware groups that aim at home users started adding spyware to their attack chain a while ago.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Market Leaders\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAs of May 2024, 3 major malware families dominate the market \\u2013 [RedLine](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/redline), [Raccoon](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/raccoon-stealer), and [Vidar](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/vidar). All of them are not new at that point of time, with Vidar being active for the longest time. Let\\u2019s have a closer look at them, starting with the youngest one.\\n\\n### RedLine Infostealer\\n\\n**RedLine infostealer appeared in 2020**, and saw a pretty wide application in different cyberattacks. Most of the time, however, it was aimed against single users, as its functionality fits best for this purpose. Key targets for the RedLine are cryptocurrency wallet data, both from desktop versions and browser plugins. Still, it can gather other data, like FTP/VPN configurations and session tokens for apps like Discord or Steam. Having a pretty large market share at the edge of 2024, it became much less active starting from March 2024. Yet [an enormous number of new samples](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/redline-stealer-100000-samples/) that popped out recently may be the sign of another campaign getting ready. The RedLine developers find hackers who buy this malware is through Telegram groups and Darknet forums.\\n\\n![Image 2: Redline promotion in Telegram](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/redline-tg-promo.webp)\\n\\nTelegram group post that advertises Redline malware\\n\\n### Raccoon Infostealer\\n\\nRaccoon has key properties similar to ones RedLine offers, but is capable of capturing a much wider selection of data. In its scope are **browser autofill files, cookies, and online banking credentials**, on top of the ability to pluck cryptocurrency wallets. Since the emergence in early 2019, Raccoon was holding dominant positions on the market \\u2013 and keeps holding them even now. In the summer 2022, its developers released a new version, promising faster and more reliable malware for a slightly bigger pay. Same as RedLine, Raccoon stealer is commonly spread through ads in Telegram channels and bots; [Darknet platforms are less preferred](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/malware-propagation-darknet/), though are used for public communication.\\n\\n![Image 3: Raccoon stealer admin panel](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/raccoon-admin-panel.webp)\\n\\nAdmin panel of Raccoon stealer\\n\\n### Vidar Infostealer\\n\\nAmong top 3 Infostealer threats, Vidar is most definitely a dark horse. It is considered to be an offspring of **Arkei stealer**, malware that made quite an image back in early 10\\u2019s. After the launch in 2018, it never had a dominant share on the market, being at best #2. Nonetheless, its efficiency and unique design is hard to deny \\u2013 Vidar offers a modular approach towards data stealing and has an uncommon way of C2 communication. It also performs self-destruction after the successful data exfiltration. Additionally, it is often spread in a bundle with other malware, [such as STOP/Djvu ransomware](https://gridinsoft.com/ransomware/djvu). Methods of selling it to cybercriminals, however, are less unique \\u2013 it uses Telegram channels dedicated to malware promotion.\\n\\nNewbies\\n-------\\n\\nIt would be quite reckless to deny the importance of new malware. For sure, not all of them will make it even to the 1-year milestone, but Raccoon and Vidar once were newbies as well \\u2013 and you can see where they are. Among stealer families that popped out over the last year, there are a couple you should keep in mind.\\n\\n### Lumma\\n\\nAlso known as LummaC2, this infostealer appeared in December 2022. At the outset of familiarity with this malware, you can already see some fairly noteworthy details. At the \\u201cpricing plans\\u201d panel, developers mention the ability to configure the payload in a specific manner, and add network sniffer functionality. The presence of these functions depends on the price of the chosen plan \\u2013 **$250, $500 or $1,000**. Additionally, masters offer access to malware and panel source codes and the right to sell them \\u2013 for $20,000. Other functions, however, are available regardless of the plan. Lumma can grab browser cookies, autofill forms, data from 2FA plugins/apps, and crypto wallets credentials \\u2013 from both apps and browser plugins.\\n\\n![Image 4: Lumma infostealer pricing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lummac2-pricings.webp)\\n\\nPricings for different LummaC2 stealer plans, posted on the Darknet website\\n\\n### Stealc\\n\\nStealc is another youngster, which was first mentioned on January 9, 2023, on several Darknet forums. It appears to utilise best practices from most popular stealers, which already makes it pretty potent. Among unusual practices is a free test and weekly releases of new features. As for other functions, malware has a classic set of a modern infostealer: it gathers data from web browsers (cookies, autofill forms etc), cryptocurrency wallets extensions and even email clients and messengers. Such extended functionality, especially compared to other new malware examples, will definitely be appreciated.\\n\\nHow to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nProtection against threats like infostealer is always a tough question to answer. Thing is, malware like this is forced to evolve constantly, finding new ways to be more efficient and stealthy. This makes any advice that reacts to some malware features useless in the long-term. However, there are still some things Infostealer Malware developers can\\u2019t (or don\\u2019t want to) change.\\n\\n**Beware of [spear phishing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/spear-phishing/).** It may have different forms \\u2013 from email messages that are sent from a compromised business email to posts in social media from the hijacked account of a legit company. But even after all the sophistications, hackers can never make a check-proof legend. Most commonly, they attract victims by urgent events or exclusive deals. A simple source check will reveal any possible scam \\u2013 if the impersonated company has nothing to do with such claims, ignore the spooking message.\\n\\n**Avoid using pirated software.** Despite losing a significant portion of market share due to email spam expansion, software cracks are still used for malware spreading. Torrent-trackers and third party websites are flooded with numerous offers on a brand new software \\u2013 and try to guess which one is infected. Using only licensed software will not make you clear before the law, but also nail any risk of malware injection. And, believe me \\u2013 dealing with malware activity consequences will cost you way more than you can save on program licences.\\n\\n**Protect your system with proper anti-malware software.** Yes, it is better to avoid muddy waters at all, but having a security tool that will take care of problems will make your life much easier. Not any utility will fit though, as infostealer malware have some tricks to avoid basic anti-malware software. GridinSoft Anti-Malware gives them no chances, thanks to its three-component detection system and constant updates that retain its databases\\u2019 relevance.\\n\\n[![Image 5: What is Infostealer Malware?

decorative header for the What is Infostealer Malware\\\" post](https://www.magnetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MF_Blog_Infostealer_Header_1600x550-1.png)\\n\\nWhat is Infostealer Malware?\\n============================\\n\\nWhat are Infostealer Malware?\\u00a0\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealers are a type of malware specifically designed to locate and exfiltrate credentials. Their prevalence and impact were limited pre-COVID-19 as most of the headlines were grabbed by ransomware operations that crippled large organizations. Remote and hybrid working models helped to maintain productivity which put pressure on IT departments to facilitate this by accelerating digital transformation strategies. At the same time, there was a significant uptick in the number of known Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) operations as well as growth in the number of malware variants seen in the wild.\\n\\nNow, a complete ecosystem has developed to facilitate the monetization of various aspects of their operations, like how organizations outsource certain tasks so they can focus on their specialty.\\u00a0 This has lowered the bar for crime groups to enter the market.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we\\u2019ll introduce the top five (as of March 2023) infostealer families, including their capabilities and context to the broader infostealer threat.\\n\\nThe Origins of Infostealers\\u00a0\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe origins of infostealers trace back to ransomware which took off in the early 2010s with examples including [Reveton and the more well-known CryptoLocker](https://outpost24.com/blog/a-history-of-ransomware).\\n\\nInfostealers are not new. Many existing banking trojans and ransomware had similar functionality that [you might find in infostealers](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa19-339a). One of the major differences is that the business model has evolved from malicious groups requiring expertise in developing malware to being able to acquire it as a service. This has also presented existing developers with another potential revenue stream.\\n\\nDuring the first half of 2022, [Group-IB identified many Russian-speaking groups](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/professional-stealers/) distributing infostealer malware that had collectively infected over 890,000 user devices and stolen over 50 million passwords, an increase of 80% over the previous period. Not to mention the over [2 billion cookie files, 100,000+ crypto wallets and 100,000+ credit card](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/professional-stealers/)s. The FBI estimates that over 50 million unique credentials (email addresses, bank accounts etc.) were stolen [using Raccoon Stealer](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/newly-unsealed-indictment-charges-ukrainian-national-international-cybercrime-operation), which targeted millions of potential victims around the world. Groups or individuals who utilize infostealers will typically sell their stash of credentials they have obtained, also known as \\u2018logs,\\u2019 either to automated underground marketplaces or on public forums on the dark web. There is even recent evidence of marketplaces [moving to Telegram](https://ke-la.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/KELA_Telegram_CEBIN.pdf).\\n\\nThese groups/individuals are known as [Initial Access Brokers (IABs),](https://www.recordedfuture.com/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks) and they sell access to the most high-profile networks to the highest bidder. Many high-profile attacks in recent years have been caused by credential material obtained on these marketplaces. Accounts were compromised at Electronic Arts in June 2021, Uber in Sept 2022, Cisco in August 2022, and Microsoft in March 2022 [with stolen credentials](https://ke-la.com/2easy-logs-marketplace-on-the-rise/).\\n\\nThe largest log markets are Russian-speaking, and growth in these has been significant over the last few years. TwoEasy (2easy) is one of these markets that started in 2019. In July 2020, it offered logs harvested from approximately 28,000 machines, and by 2021 this had grown to 600,000 machines. In Figure 1, we can see the [total number of logs](https://ke-la.com/defender-in-the-middle-how-to-reduce-damage-from-info-stealing-malware/) across 3 of the biggest Russian-speaking market trending upwards.\\n\\n![Image 10: A graph showing the number of compromised accounts offered for sale on the botnet marketplaces in 2022, broken out by TwoEasy, Russian Market and Genesis sources.](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/f064eb10056126becec773aab63f255d)\\n\\nFigure 1 Source: [https://ke-la.com/defender-in-the-middle-how-to-reduce-damage-from-info-stealing-malware/](https://ke-la.com/defender-in-the-middle-how-to-reduce-damage-from-info-stealing-malware/)\\n\\nThis research from KELA also displayed the relative splits in the type of infostealer malware used to steal the credential material between January and July 2022 on the Russian Market, TwoEast and Genesis.\\n\\n![Image 12: A graph showing Elastic's Global Threat Report, showing the number of detections of Raccoon, Redline, AXORult and Vidar in 7 months of 2022. ](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/f064eb10056126becec773aab63f255d)\\n\\nFigure 2 Source: [https://ke-la.com/information-stealers-a-new-landscape/](https://ke-la.com/information-stealers-a-new-landscape/)\\u00a0\\n\\nOn the detection side, [Elastic\\u2019s Global Threat Report](https://www.elastic.co/explore/security-without-limits/global-threat-report) showed a significant increase in the proportion of infostealer malware detected on its Windows endpoints. Both AgentTesla and Redline show significant increases in detections.\\n\\nTop 5 Families of Infostealers\\u00a0\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe top 5 families of Infostealers detected most frequently across a wide range of security vendors are:\\n\\n*   Raccoon (v1 and v2)\\u00a0\\n*   RedLine\\u00a0\\n*   AgentTesla\\u00a0\\n*   Vidar\\u00a0\\n*   AZOrult\\u00a0\\n\\nTheir main capabilities and a brief overview of each are highlighted in the next section, however more detail can be found in the references. While most infostealers have a wide range of capabilities to utilise for credential theft, most of them can also be used as Remote Access Trojans (RAT) and provide follow-on deployment opportunities for other malware. Conversely, other types of malware like banking trojans can also go on to deploy infostealers on to the machine.\\n\\n### Raccoon\\u00a0\\n\\nRaccoon v1 was released [early 2019 with support stopping March 2022](https://ke-la.com/information-stealers-a-new-landscape/), with the group stating it was due to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In June 2022 v2 was released by the developers that [steals the following](https://d01a.github.io/raccoon-stealer/#firefox):\\n\\n*   Information stored in browsers (passwords / cookies / autofill information and credit cards)\\u00a0\\n*   System information\\u00a0\\n*   Telegram Desktop application\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n*   Take a screenshot\\u00a0\\n*   Drop and execute a file\\u00a0\\n*   Steal desktop crypto wallets\\u00a0\\n*   Screenshots\\u00a0\\n*   File grabber\\u00a0\\n\\n### RedLine\\u00a0\\n\\n[First spotted in March 2020](https://therecord.media/redline-stealer-identified-as-primary-source-of-stolen-credentials-on-two-dark-web-markets) and still under active development, the latest detailed analysis of a RedLine sample established that it [steals the following](https://securityscorecard.com/research/detailed-analysis-redline-stealer/):\\n\\n*   Information stored in browsers (passwords / cookies / autofill information and credit cards)\\n*   System information\\n*   Telegram Desktop application\\n*   Take a screenshot\\n*   Drop and execute a file\\n*   Steal desktop crypto wallets\\n*   Screenshots\\n*   File grabber\\n\\n### AgentTesla\\u00a0\\n\\nCommonly referred to as a [Remote Access Trojan (RAT)](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/02/02/catching-the-rat-called-agent-tesla), AgentTesla has been [around since 2014](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/02/02/catching-the-rat-called-agent-tesla) and has a lot of functionality that is commonly associated with infostealers:\\n\\n*   System information\\u00a0\\n*   Information stored in browsers (passwords / cookies / autofill information and credit cards)\\u00a0\\n*   Keylogging\\u00a0\\n*   Steals clipboard data\\u00a0\\n*   Screenshots\\u00a0\\n*   VPN Credentials\\u00a0\\n*   FTP Credentials\\u00a0\\n*   Email client credentials\\u00a0\\n\\n### Vidar\\u00a0\\n\\nVidar is an evolved version of the Arkei infostealer and has been around since around 2018. Initially it used gaming platforms for distribution of C2 IP addresses and configurations but has since moved to social media platforms. [It steals](https://www.secureworks.com/about/press/secureworks-state-of-the-threat-report-2022) the following:\\n\\n*   Information stored in browsers (passwords / cookies / autofill information and credit cards)\\u00a0\\n*   Tor Browser Information\\u00a0\\n*   Email clients\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n*   Crypto wallets\\u00a0\\n*   FTP clients\\u00a0\\n*   2FA software\\u00a0\\n*   Messenger Apps (Telegram/Thunderbird/Pidgin/Bat!)\\u00a0\\n*   Crypto Wallets\\u00a0\\n*   File grabber\\u00a0\\n*   Screenshots\\u00a0\\n*   Installed software\\u00a0\\n*   Download and execute payload\\u00a0\\n\\nOne interesting difference between Vidar and existing infostealers, is that [Vidar erases itself](https://fumik0.com/2018/12/24/lets-dig-into-vidar-an-arkei-copycat-forked-stealer-in-depth-analysis/) once it has collected the required information. Others typically hang around awaiting commands from the operator.\\n\\n### AZOrult\\u00a0\\n\\nOperating since 2016 AZOrult is another common commodity infostealer, development stopped in 2018 and it was released as a free product. Infostealers exist that utilise portions [of AZOrult currently and it steals](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2019/06/threat-spotlight-analyzing-azorult-infostealer-malware):\\n\\n*   Information stored in browsers (passwords / cookies / autofill information and credit cards)\\u00a0\\n*   Email client information\\u00a0\\n*   Crypto wallets\\u00a0\\n*   FTP clients\\u00a0\\n*   Steam\\u00a0\\n*   Desktop messaging clients (Telegram and Skype)\\u00a0\\n*   Download and execute payload\\u00a0\\n\\nThe lists of functionalities for all infostealers here should be treated as snapshots of the infostealers capabilities as developers may add/remove functionalities and only certain samples will be analysed.\\n\\nDelivery Methods\\u00a0\\n-----------------\\n\\nThere are two main delivery methods used for infostealer malware that can be broadly grouped in to phishing and non-phishing methods. Both are then further divided in sub-methods \\u2013 note that the phishing diagram only represents email attachments as a tactic and does not include phishing emails that link to a malicious site (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\\n\\n![Image 14: A graphic showing the delivery methods for infostealer malware in a phishing threat. ](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/f064eb10056126becec773aab63f255d)\\n\\nFigure 4 Source: [https://thedfirreport.com/2023/03/06/2022-year-in-review/](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/03/06/2022-year-in-review/)\\u00a0\\n\\n![Image 16: A graphic showing the delivery methods for infostealer malware in a non-phishing threats. ](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/f064eb10056126becec773aab63f255d)\\n\\nFigure 5 Source: [https://thedfirreport.com/2023/03/06/2022-year-in-review/](https://thedfirreport.com/2023/03/06/2022-year-in-review/)\\u00a0\\n\\nMalvertising as a New Non-Phishing Delivery Method\\u00a0\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMore recently, the non-phishing approach has utilised malvertising and compromised accounts on social media platforms to push content that contains links to malicious websites. Reputable social media accounts (e.g., Facebook or YouTube) post material that leads users to a malicious website with a legitimate looking domain, mimicking a legitimate one. The malware is then downloaded from the site and executed by the user unwittingly. These methods are typically not circulated in online user security literature. It uses the reputation of the compromised account to increase the likelihood that the user visits the malicious site.\\n\\n![Image 18: A screenshot of a video array from YouTube showing how malicious content can be surfaced with SEO poisoning. ](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/f064eb10056126becec773aab63f255d)\\n\\nFigure 6 Source: [https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infostealing-killed-the-video-star-youtube-targeted-in-expansive-russian-c2-malware-operation](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infostealing-killed-the-video-star-youtube-targeted-in-expansive-russian-c2-malware-operation)\\u00a0\\n\\nAdvertising networks are complex and deal with large quantities of data making validation of submitted ads difficult. Malicious actors [submit legitimate looking ads that are then displayed on reputable websites.](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infostealing-killed-the-video-star-youtube-targeted-in-expansive-russian-c2-malware-operation) Users click on them believing that because they are shown on a reputable site they must be trustworthy too. Once clicked, they then lead to a website masquerading as legitimate software when in fact it is malware.\\n\\nAnother form of malvertising abuses paid-for search results by inserting links to malicious sites at the top of the search engine results as paid ads. An example flow of actions is in the next diagram (Figure 7).\\n\\nBoth tactics phish users interested in legitimate software that focuses on business-critical functions, common examples include [Slack and Adobe Photoshop](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infostealing-killed-the-video-star-youtube-targeted-in-expansive-russian-c2-malware-operation).\\n\\n![Image 20: A graphic showing the workflow of how infostealer malware can be delivered with Google Ads using malvertising.](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/12523620199f0e370ce04646f011f4a3)\\n\\nFigure 7 Source: [https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/new-malvertising-campaign-via-google.html](https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/new-malvertising-campaign-via-google.html)\\u00a0\\n\\nPhishing email campaigns have also diversified their delivery methods by not only using malicious attachments but also creating emails that contain links to these legitimate-looking software sites, resulting in credential loss or installation of malware. An overview of the various attack flows using phishing emails is shown below.\\n\\n![Image 22: A graphics showing the various attack flows using phishing emails to deliver infostealer malware.](blob:https://www.magnetforensics.com/4f67bf01bf30883a407c39fddcafa5ec)\\n\\nFigure 8 Source: [https://www.calyptix.com/educational-resources/infographic-phishing-email-attack-flow/](https://www.calyptix.com/educational-resources/infographic-phishing-email-attack-flow/)\\n\\nConclusion\\u00a0\\n-----------\\n\\nInfostealers have proven to be an effective method to compromise both corporate and non-corporate machines lowering the bar to entry for criminal individuals or groups. The diversification in the delivery methods has also led to an increase in compromised credential material. Detections of infostealer malware and the increase in the amount of material for sale on underground forums has increased over the last few years and shows no sign of slowing down. While ransomware is still a significant concern to businesses, infostealers are providing more opportunities for less technically savvy criminals to impact individual users and large corporations. As more businesses lean-in to hybrid working and find new ways of conducting business electronically, infostealers will present a significant and increasing risk going forward.\\n\\n### Investigating a Malware Attack with Magnet AXIOM Cyber\\u00a0\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not a question of if a cyber attack will happen, but when.\\n\\nMagnet AXIOM Cyber is a robust digital forensics and incident response solution for businesses that need to perform remote acquisitions and collect & analyze evidence from computers, the cloud, and mobile devices.\\n\\nTo learn more about the incident response capabilities of AXIOM Cyber visit our [Incident Response](https://www.magnetforensics.com/incident-response/) hub to review blogs, how-to videos, and webinars on each of the features outlined above.
