            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.   Nearly all files are digitally signed by of “Foshan Yongqiheng Trading Co., Ltd.” The metadata for each file—including copyright, product, description, internal name, and comments—reflects the name under which it was downloaded. Notably, the signing date aligns with the download date.    Other samples are signed by “Langfang Alkem Material Technology Co., Ltd.”, including those with the following hashes:   42c1550b035353ae529e98304f89bf6065647833e582d08f0228185b493d0022 8d911ef72bdb4ec5b99b7548c0c89ffc8639068834a5e2b684c9d78504550927 92d2488e401d24a4bfc1598d813bc53af5c225769efedf0c7e5e4083623f4486 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 aa25a7c2520da54ba2045a21de252632c93f8eae06e031091ab908dca4eadf45    The only file lacking a digital signature in the list shown above is 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 Regarding the tayakay[.]com domain, when a user visits the site that is embedded with tayakay[.]com JS script, it constructs a query parameter containing victim information – such as device name, IP address and others – to send to the js.php endpoint.   By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

In both incidents, the victim was redirected to a malicious URL that prompted them to verify they were human by completing the actions shown in Figure 1.

            "In 2023, CTU researchers warned about the growing threat from infostealers. Threat actors regularly use infostealers to obtain credentials for a wide range of online services and corporate networks. The criminals then sell this access in  underground marketplaces or use the access to conduct attacks such as phishing hotel customers. CTU analysis of underground activity related to the September 2024 incident response engagements revealed that credentials collected from victims of the fake human verification prompt were published to Russian Market within days of collection.\n",
            "CTU researchers recommend that organizations implement policies restricting employees from using corporate systems to browse for streaming services or risky content. Organizations should also conduct regular social engineering training that incorporates up-to-date threat intelligence on the latest techniques. Using web proxies to limit access to potentially malicious web pages could mitigate this threat.\n",

            "Text: Executive Summary\n",
            "We recently discovered a novel version of the RomCom malware family called SnipBot and, for the first time, show post-infection activity from the attacker on a victim system. This new strain makes use of new tricks and unique code obfuscation methods in addition to those seen in previous versions of RomCom 3.0 and PEAPOD (RomCom 4.0).\n",
            "In early April, our sandbox Advanced WildFire discovered an unusual DLL module that turned out to be part of a broader tool set called SnipBot. By examining the malware sample and using Cortex XDR telemetry data, we were able to reconstruct the infection chain and the attacker's subsequent actions.\n",
            "We also discovered more related malware strains dating back to December 2023. Although the aim of the attacker is unknown, the behavior we observed indicates an attempt to pivot through the victim's network and exfiltrate certain files.\n",
            "SnipBot gives the attacker the ability to execute commands and download additional modules onto a victim's system. It is a new version of the RomCom malware that is mainly based on RomCom 3.0. However, it also contains techniques seen in its offshoot PEAPOD called RomCom 4.0 by Trend Micro. Therefore, we’ve assigned it version 5.0.\n",
            "This threat operates in several stages, with the initial downloader always being an executable, followed by further EXEs or DLLs. The downloader we observed was consistently signed with a valid code signing certificate that the threat actor likely obtained either through certificate theft or fraud to purchase a new certificate, while subsequent modules were unsigned.\n",
            "In collaboration with Sophos, which initially found this new RomCom version in February during an incident, we investigated the malware's capabilities and gathered some knowledge about the attackers' activity on a victim’s system.\n",
            "Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the SnipBot malware through products like Cortex and Advanced WildFire, with its different memory analysis features. Advanced WildFire classifies the SnipBot malware samples in this article as malicious. Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security classify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious.\n",
            "If you think you might have been compromised or have an urgent matter, contact the Unit 42 Incident Response team.\n",
            " Related Unit 42 Topics \n",
            "  Backdoors ,  RomCom  \n",
            "  Malware Background\n",
            " RomCom RAT is a malware family that has evolved over the years to include different features and attack methods. The threat actor using RomCom has been active since at least 2022. They engage in ransomware, extortion and targeted credential gathering, likely to support intelligence-gathering operations. RomCom has made multiple advancements, leading to its newest iteration called SnipBot, which employs new commands and evasion techniques.\n",
            "The SnipBot variant of RomCom leverages a basic set of features that allows the attacker to run commands on a victim's system and download additional modules. The initial payload is always either an executable downloader masked as a PDF file or an actual PDF file sent to the victim in an email that leads to an executable.\n",
            "The earliest initial sample of SnipBot we found was a PDF file that shows distorted text that states a font is missing that’s needed to show it correctly. If the victim clicks on the contained link that’s purported to download and install the font package, they will instead download the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "SnipBot consists of several stages where the initial downloader is always an executable file and the remaining payloads are either EXEs or DLLs. The downloader is always signed with a legitimate and valid code signing certificate. We don’t know how the threat actors obtain these certificates, but it’s likely they steal them or gain them by fraud. Subsequent modules were not signed.\n",
            "  Email Infection Vector\n",
            "By reviewing Cortex XDR telemetry data and reverse engineering the initial sample, we were able to recreate the whole infection chain. The initial infection vector in our case was an email that contained a link that redirects twice to the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows the chain of URLs from the initial one contained in the email to the final SnipBot downloader file link. The attacker registered the domains and . The website is a legitimate file sharing service with a set hosting period of three days.\n",
            " Figure 1. URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "We discovered another chain of links that was likely used by the same attacker to deliver a similar SnipBot downloader variant. The distinct initial domain and the similar downloader file name imply this was part of a campaign targeting multiple victims.\n",
            "Figure 2 shows another chain of URLs used in another attack. The attacker created the domain ; it is not a legitimate file sharing service.\n",
            " Figure 2. Different URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "  SnipBot Malware\n",
            "Figure 3 shows the infection chain of the different SnipBot stages. The initial downloader is a 64-bit Windows executable (SHA256: ) disguised as a PDF file. It is signed with a presumably stolen or spoofed certificate from , which is a company located in Denmark.\n",
            " Figure 3. SnipBot execution flow from the initial EXE downloader to the main bot file (icon sources). \n",
            "This downloader uses two simple yet effective anti-sandbox tricks. The first one checks for the original file name by comparing the hashed process name against a hard-coded value. The second one checks whether there are at least 100 entries in the registry key, which is usually the case on a regular user’s system but less likely to be the case in a sandbox system.\n",
            " \n",
            "Figure 4 shows the registry key of a typical Windows system with more than 100 values present.\n",
            " Figure 4. registry key of a typical Windows system. \n",
            "The downloader is also obfuscated with a window message-based control-flow obfuscation algorithm. The malware code is split up into multiple unordered blocks that are triggered by custom window messages.\n",
            "To accomplish this, a window is created that has a callback message that contains these code blocks. The window message queue is used to call each block in its original order.\n",
            "The first message block is triggered by sending the initial message and then each block sends the next message when it’s done. Additionally, each block can also send nested messages, which makes it even more challenging to follow the execution flow.\n",
            " \n",
            "Most of the strings, such as the command and control (C2) domain name and all the names of dynamically resolved API functions, are encrypted. The threat actor likely did this to prevent easy static detection, thus making malware analysis more time-consuming.\n",
            "Upon execution, the downloader contacts the first C2 domain and tries to get a PDF file and the first payload. We couldn’t recover the original downloaded first payload, but for an unknown reason, the attacker later downloaded the same payload with different configuration data and started it manually. We were able to obtain this file and could continue our analysis.\n",
            "The threat downloads the PDF to the local user’s temporary folder with a random name before opening it. The first payload is a DLL file (internally named ) that the threat executes in memory. It has an exported function named that contains its malicious code.\n",
            "This DLL file’s purpose is to download the next stage COM DLL named from the second C2 and inject it into Explorer. For this, it uses COM hijacking to register the file as the thumbnail cache library in the registry hive of the current user.\n",
            "When restarting , the DLL gets loaded into its address space and executed. While this is a reliable method of loading a payload into Explorer, forcing it to terminate can result in a crash, as it did on the victim's machine.\n",

            "Lumar initially responded to App-Bound Encryption by implementing a temporary solution that required launching the malware with admin rights, but followed with a bypass mechanism that works with the privileges of the logged-in user.\n",
            "The developers of Lumma Stealer assured its customer that they don't need to execute the malware with admin privileges for the cookie theft to work.\n",
            "“Added a new method of collecting Chrome cookies. The new method does not require admin rights and/or restart, which simplifies the crypt build and reduces the chances of detection, and thus increase the knock rate.” – developers of Lumma Stealer\n",

Enduring Legacy Of Infostealer Malware\\u2014What You Can Do\\n==========================================================\\n\\nMay 30, 2024 16:31 GMT\\n\\nDespite a relatively unsophisticated methodology by modern standards, infostealer malware is a timeless favorite of cyberattackers and data thieves. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\n![Image 10](https://innovatecybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Timeless-Legacy-of-Infostealer-Malwarewhat-you-can-do-f-800x448.jpg)\\n\\nInfostealer malware, also known as information-stealing malware, has a rich and nefarious history of cybercrime and cyberattacks. Like a sneaky robber, it hides on computers, unnoticed. Infostealer malware\\u2019s origins can be traced back to the early days of computer viruses and malware, which were particularly prevalent during the 1990s and early 2000s.\\n\\nDecades later, infostealer malware is still on the rise and continues to impact organizations through relatively unsophisticated methods, despite the maturation of the security industry. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\nOrigins of Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware, short for information-stealer, is a type of malware that primarily aims to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information. It typically targets login information, bank details, cryptocurrency wallets, and personally identifiable information such as SSNs and dates of birth. The pilfered data is a valuable resource for hackers, who may exploit it for identity theft, taking control of online profiles, or carrying out monetary assaults.\\n\\nMost often, this is accomplished via searching for file names and extensions that have been identified as valuable, as well as directly targeting applications known to contain sensitive information, mainly browsers and messaging applications.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Development\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe development and distribution of infostealer malware closely follow the rise of MaaS (malware as a service) models. These have become increasingly popular in cybercrime circles over the past few years.\\n\\nAn individual or a group creates the malware builder or executable and then offers it for sale to less experienced attackers on darknet markets or Telegram groups. This allows less-skilled attackers to distribute their purchased payload as they please, often through popular methods like phishing or malicious advertisements.\\n\\nKey Players in Infostealer Malware\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nRedline, Vidar, and Raccoon Stealers are a few notable players who have long dominated the Infostealer scene. The strains all employ similar methods: they function by dumping saved credentials, session cookies, and saved payment methods within the browser, giving attackers access to the associated accounts. Session cookies will allow attackers to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions.\\n\\nThreat actors will also attempt to hijack crypto wallets and Discord accounts, which are then used for further propagation of the malware. After taking over an infected machine\\u2019s Discord account, automated messages will be sent to the user\\u2019s contact list, prompting them to download the executable to start the cycle all over again.\\n\\nSpray and Pray\\n--------------\\n\\nIn the minds of cybersecurity professionals, infostealer malware has been disregarded as an issue for consumers rather than organizations due to its \\u201cspray-and-pray\\u201d method of infection and wide availability. However, that same logic, if reversed, is the exact reason why organizations should be aware, cautious, and prepared for these infections.\\n\\nAs with many malware types, all it takes is one wrong click on a phishing attachment or malicious advertisement to publish sensitive data such as PII or even corporate login credentials to the darknet markets. With the seemingly endless number of malicious sites and emails, infection becomes even more likely.\\n\\nRecommendations For Fighting Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStopping infostealer malware is similar to preventing typical infections from RATs or other malware. AV and EDR tools are typically tuned in to the IOCs and TTPs associated with the larger names in the infostealer scene. However, no single tool should be the only measure of prevention of infection or the mitigation of post-infection activities.\\n\\nCybersecurity threat hunters frequently observe first-hand the failings of signature-based and even behavioral or heuristic tools. This is not to say these tools are useless or unnecessary, but rather that it is crucial to implement several layers of security to prevent these infections. Adding tools such as network DLP, email attachment defenses, and proactive security monitoring/threat hunting will significantly increase the chances of stopping these attacks in their tracks.\\n\\nHere are some effective mitigations that are recommended to keep infostealer malware from gaining a hold in your environment:\\n\\n##### Email Security\\n\\nInfostealers are most commonly distributed via phishing and malspam campaigns, making email (more specifically, attachment-based security tools) a good first line of defense against these infections.\\n\\nAs a common tactic by threat actors to get around typical signature-based email attachment security, blocking emails with a.zip archive attachment from unknown senders is a good first step.\\n\\nAs always, phishing awareness training is another crucial step to prevent infection should a malicious email sneak through.\\n\\n##### Web Security\\n\\nMalvertising, or malicious advertising techniques, is another attack vector that info thieves frequently use.. These techniques employ search engine ads in order to pose as legitimate and popular software downloads, which have been replaced with an infostealer.\\n\\nWeb filtering is another tool which should be added to the lineup to prevent accidental trojanized downloads.\\n\\n##### Endpoint Protection\\n\\nAV and EDR tools provide a secondary layer of host-based detection and mitigation should a download get through the previous layers. These tools will typically detect the larger names in the infostealer scene, whether through signature-based or heuristic detections.\\n\\nA combination of both detection types is a great way to ensure malware is caught at time of download, or at runtime. However, these tools are not an end-all solution, there are many tactics that be employed by threat actors to evade these defenses.\\n\\n##### Network Security/DLP\\n\\nNetwork security tools, specifically DLP in the case of infostealers, can prevent the sensitive data collected from leaving the network and making it back to the attacker.\\n\\nDetection of exfiltration over encrypted protocols such as HTTPS can be difficult; however, some tools, such as TLS inspection, can be employed.\\n\\n##### The author\\n\\nMalachi Grimes is a Threat Analyst at
