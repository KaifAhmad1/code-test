            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.

By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems.']\n",

            "This model does not allow infostealer malware, which runs with the permissions of the logged user, to steal secrets stored in Chrome browser.\n",
            "To bypass this protection, the malware would need system privileges or to inject code into Chrome, both noisy actions that are likely to trigger warnings from security tools, said Will Harris of the Chrome security team. \n",
            "However, security researchers g0njxa and also RussianPanda9xx obseerved multiple infostealer developers boasting that they have implemented a working bypass for their tools (MeduzaStealer, Whitesnake, Lumma Stealer, Lumar (PovertyStealer), Vidar Stealer, StealC).\n",

            "Text: Executive Summary\n",
            "We recently discovered a novel version of the RomCom malware family called SnipBot and, for the first time, show post-infection activity from the attacker on a victim system. This new strain makes use of new tricks and unique code obfuscation methods in addition to those seen in previous versions of RomCom 3.0 and PEAPOD (RomCom 4.0).\n",
            "In early April, our sandbox Advanced WildFire discovered an unusual DLL module that turned out to be part of a broader tool set called SnipBot. By examining the malware sample and using Cortex XDR telemetry data, we were able to reconstruct the infection chain and the attacker's subsequent actions.\n",
            "We also discovered more related malware strains dating back to December 2023. Although the aim of the attacker is unknown, the behavior we observed indicates an attempt to pivot through the victim's network and exfiltrate certain files.\n",
            "SnipBot gives the attacker the ability to execute commands and download additional modules onto a victim's system. It is a new version of the RomCom malware that is mainly based on RomCom 3.0. However, it also contains techniques seen in its offshoot PEAPOD called RomCom 4.0 by Trend Micro. Therefore, we’ve assigned it version 5.0.\n",
            "This threat operates in several stages, with the initial downloader always being an executable, followed by further EXEs or DLLs. The downloader we observed was consistently signed with a valid code signing certificate that the threat actor likely obtained either through certificate theft or fraud to purchase a new certificate, while subsequent modules were unsigned.\n",
            "In collaboration with Sophos, which initially found this new RomCom version in February during an incident, we investigated the malware's capabilities and gathered some knowledge about the attackers' activity on a victim’s system.\n",
            "Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the SnipBot malware through products like Cortex and Advanced WildFire, with its different memory analysis features. Advanced WildFire classifies the SnipBot malware samples in this article as malicious. Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security classify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious.\n",

            "  Backdoors ,  RomCom  \n",
            "  Malware Background\n",
            " RomCom RAT is a malware family that has evolved over the years to include different features and attack methods. The threat actor using RomCom has been active since at least 2022. They engage in ransomware, extortion and targeted credential gathering, likely to support intelligence-gathering operations. RomCom has made multiple advancements, leading to its newest iteration called SnipBot, which employs new commands and evasion techniques.\n",
            "The SnipBot variant of RomCom leverages a basic set of features that allows the attacker to run commands on a victim's system and download additional modules. The initial payload is always either an executable downloader masked as a PDF file or an actual PDF file sent to the victim in an email that leads to an executable.\n",
            "The earliest initial sample of SnipBot we found was a PDF file that shows distorted text that states a font is missing that’s needed to show it correctly. If the victim clicks on the contained link that’s purported to download and install the font package, they will instead download the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "SnipBot consists of several stages where the initial downloader is always an executable file and the remaining payloads are either EXEs or DLLs. The downloader is always signed with a legitimate and valid code signing certificate. We don’t know how the threat actors obtain these certificates, but it’s likely they steal them or gain them by fraud. Subsequent modules were not signed.\n",
            "  Email Infection Vector\n",
            "By reviewing Cortex XDR telemetry data and reverse engineering the initial sample, we were able to recreate the whole infection chain. The initial infection vector in our case was an email that contained a link that redirects twice to the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows the chain of URLs from the initial one contained in the email to the final SnipBot downloader file link. The attacker registered the domains and . The website is a legitimate file sharing service with a set hosting period of three days.\n",
            " Figure 1. URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "We discovered another chain of links that was likely used by the same attacker to deliver a similar SnipBot downloader variant. The distinct initial domain and the similar downloader file name imply this was part of a campaign targeting multiple victims.\n",
            "Figure 2 shows another chain of URLs used in another attack. The attacker created the domain ; it is not a legitimate file sharing service.\n",
            " Figure 2. Different URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "  SnipBot Malware\n",
            "Figure 3 shows the infection chain of the different SnipBot stages. The initial downloader is a 64-bit Windows executable (SHA256: ) disguised as a PDF file. It is signed with a presumably stolen or spoofed certificate from , which is a company located in Denmark.\n",
            " Figure 3. SnipBot execution flow from the initial EXE downloader to the main bot file (icon sources). \n",
            "This downloader uses two simple yet effective anti-sandbox tricks. The first one checks for the original file name by comparing the hashed process name against a hard-coded value. The second one checks whether there are at least 100 entries in the registry key, which is usually the case on a regular user’s system but less likely to be the case in a sandbox system.\n",
            " \n",
            "Figure 4 shows the registry key of a typical Windows system with more than 100 values present.\n",
            " Figure 4. registry key of a typical Windows system. \n",
            "The downloader is also obfuscated with a window message-based control-flow obfuscation algorithm. The malware code is split up into multiple unordered blocks that are triggered by custom window messages.\n",
            "To accomplish this, a window is created that has a callback message that contains these code blocks. The window message queue is used to call each block in its original order.\n",
            "The first message block is triggered by sending the initial message and then each block sends the next message when it’s done. Additionally, each block can also send nested messages, which makes it even more challenging to follow the execution flow.\n",
            " \n",
            "Most of the strings, such as the command and control (C2) domain name and all the names of dynamically resolved API functions, are encrypted. The threat actor likely did this to prevent easy static detection, thus making malware analysis more time-consuming.\n",
            "Upon execution, the downloader contacts the first C2 domain and tries to get a PDF file and the first payload. We couldn’t recover the original downloaded first payload, but for an unknown reason, the attacker later downloaded the same payload with different configuration data and started it manually. We were able to obtain this file and could continue our analysis.\n",
            "The threat downloads the PDF to the local user’s temporary folder with a random name before opening it. The first payload is a DLL file (internally named ) that the threat executes in memory. It has an exported function named that contains its malicious code.\n",
            "This DLL file’s purpose is to download the next stage COM DLL named from the second C2 and inject it into Explorer. For this, it uses COM hijacking to register the file as the thumbnail cache library in the registry hive of the current user.\n",
            "When restarting , the DLL gets loaded into its address space and executed. While this is a reliable method of loading a payload into Explorer, forcing it to terminate can result in a crash, as it did on the victim's machine.\n",

One of the most massive malware types in the modern threat landscape \\u2013 **Infostealer Malware** \\u2013 appears to enter a new stage of development. Though its major names remain the same, some new malware families with promising features popped out. Let\\u2019s have a peek at all of them and see what to expect.\\n\\n[Infostealer Malware Market in 2024](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-in-2024)[Infostealer Malware Market Leaders](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-leaders)[RedLine Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#redline-infostealer)[Raccoon Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#raccoon-infostealer)[Vidar Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#vidar-infostealer)[Newbies](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#newbies)[Lumma](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#lumma)[Stealc](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#stealc)[How to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#how-to-protect-against-infostealer-malware)\\n\\nInfostealer malware gained more and more popularity during the last decade. However, the biggest spike happened during the last few years. The first noticeable factor is the massive popularisation of cryptocurrencies. How is that related? Well, relatively big amounts of money always attracted the attention of hackers. Carding and banking fraud though is now less effective as banks implemented strict controlling measures back in the early \\u201810s. Cryptocurrency wallets, on the other hand, have low to no control, making them ideal targets for Infostealer.\\n\\n![Image 1: Infostealer Malware stats](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stealer-activity-2022.webp)\\n\\nAnother reason that made spyware and infostealers so popular and widespread is **their massive application in attacks on corporations**. Even when hackers break into the network to cipher the files and ask for a ransom for their decryption, they also drop an Infostealer malware that will exfiltrate as much valuable information as possible. Afterwards, [hackers request an additional ransom](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/top-famous-ransomware-groups-2022/) to keep this data secret. Some attacks are based exclusively on stealers, and the result of their job is both sold on the Darknet or used for business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Additionally, some ransomware groups that aim at home users started adding spyware to their attack chain a while ago.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Market Leaders\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAs of May 2024, 3 major malware families dominate the market \\u2013 [RedLine](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/redline), [Raccoon](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/raccoon-stealer), and [Vidar](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/vidar). All of them are not new at that point of time, with Vidar being active for the longest time. Let\\u2019s have a closer look at them, starting with the youngest one.\\n\\n### RedLine Infostealer\\n\\n**RedLine infostealer appeared in 2020**, and saw a pretty wide application in different cyberattacks. Most of the time, however, it was aimed against single users, as its functionality fits best for this purpose. Key targets for the RedLine are cryptocurrency wallet data, both from desktop versions and browser plugins. Still, it can gather other data, like FTP/VPN configurations and session tokens for apps like Discord or Steam. Having a pretty large market share at the edge of 2024, it became much less active starting from March 2024. Yet [an enormous number of new samples](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/redline-stealer-100000-samples/) that popped out recently may be the sign of another campaign getting ready. The RedLine developers find hackers who buy this malware is through Telegram groups and Darknet forums.\\n\\n![Image 2: Redline promotion in Telegram](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/redline-tg-promo.webp)\\n\\nTelegram group post that advertises Redline malware\\n\\n### Raccoon Infostealer\\n\\nRaccoon has key properties similar to ones RedLine offers, but is capable of capturing a much wider selection of data. In its scope are **browser autofill files, cookies, and online banking credentials**, on top of the ability to pluck cryptocurrency wallets. Since the emergence in early 2019, Raccoon was holding dominant positions on the market \\u2013 and keeps holding them even now. In the summer 2022, its developers released a new version, promising faster and more reliable malware for a slightly bigger pay. Same as RedLine, Raccoon stealer is commonly spread through ads in Telegram channels and bots; [Darknet platforms are less preferred](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/malware-propagation-darknet/), though are used for public communication.\\n\\n![Image 3: Raccoon stealer admin panel](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/raccoon-admin-panel.webp)\\n\\nAdmin panel of Raccoon stealer\\n\\n### Vidar Infostealer\\n\\nAmong top 3 Infostealer threats, Vidar is most definitely a dark horse. It is considered to be an offspring of **Arkei stealer**, malware that made quite an image back in early 10\\u2019s. After the launch in 2018, it never had a dominant share on the market, being at best #2. Nonetheless, its efficiency and unique design is hard to deny \\u2013 Vidar offers a modular approach towards data stealing and has an uncommon way of C2 communication. It also performs self-destruction after the successful data exfiltration. Additionally, it is often spread in a bundle with other malware, [such as STOP/Djvu ransomware](https://gridinsoft.com/ransomware/djvu). Methods of selling it to cybercriminals, however, are less unique \\u2013 it uses Telegram channels dedicated to malware promotion.\\n\\nNewbies\\n-------\\n\\nIt would be quite reckless to deny the importance of new malware. For sure, not all of them will make it even to the 1-year milestone, but Raccoon and Vidar once were newbies as well \\u2013 and you can see where they are. Among stealer families that popped out over the last year, there are a couple you should keep in mind.\\n\\n### Lumma\\n\\nAlso known as LummaC2, this infostealer appeared in December 2022. At the outset of familiarity with this malware, you can already see some fairly noteworthy details. At the \\u201cpricing plans\\u201d panel, developers mention the ability to configure the payload in a specific manner, and add network sniffer functionality. The presence of these functions depends on the price of the chosen plan \\u2013 **$250, $500 or $1,000**. Additionally, masters offer access to malware and panel source codes and the right to sell them \\u2013 for $20,000. Other functions, however, are available regardless of the plan. Lumma can grab browser cookies, autofill forms, data from 2FA plugins/apps, and crypto wallets credentials \\u2013 from both apps and browser plugins.\\n\\n![Image 4: Lumma infostealer pricing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lummac2-pricings.webp)\\n\\nPricings for different LummaC2 stealer plans, posted on the Darknet website\\n\\n### Stealc\\n\\nStealc is another youngster, which was first mentioned on January 9, 2023, on several Darknet forums. It appears to utilise best practices from most popular stealers, which already makes it pretty potent. Among unusual practices is a free test and weekly releases of new features. As for other functions, malware has a classic set of a modern infostealer: it gathers data from web browsers (cookies, autofill forms etc), cryptocurrency wallets extensions and even email clients and messengers. Such extended functionality, especially compared to other new malware examples, will definitely be appreciated.\\n\\nHow to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nProtection against threats like infostealer is always a tough question to answer. Thing is, malware like this is forced to evolve constantly, finding new ways to be more efficient and stealthy. This makes any advice that reacts to some malware features useless in the long-term. However, there are still some things Infostealer Malware developers can\\u2019t (or don\\u2019t want to) change.\\n\\n**Beware of [spear phishing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/spear-phishing/).** It may have different forms \\u2013 from email messages that are sent from a compromised business email to posts in social media from the hijacked account of a legit company. But even after all the sophistications, hackers can never make a check-proof legend. Most commonly, they attract victims by urgent events or exclusive deals. A simple source check will reveal any possible scam \\u2013 if the impersonated company has nothing to do with such claims, ignore the spooking message.\\n\\n**Avoid using pirated software.** Despite losing a significant portion of market share due to email spam expansion, software cracks are still used for malware spreading. Torrent-trackers and third party websites are flooded with numerous offers on a brand new software \\u2013 and try to guess which one is infected. Using only licensed software will not make you clear before the law, but also nail any risk of malware injection. And, believe me \\u2013 dealing with malware activity consequences will cost you way more than you can save on program licences.\\n\\n**Protect your system with proper anti-malware software.** Yes, it is better to avoid muddy waters at all, but having a security tool that will take care of problems will make your life much easier. Not any utility will fit though, as infostealer malware have some tricks to avoid basic anti-malware software. GridinSoft Anti-Malware gives them no chances, thanks to its three-component detection system and constant updates that retain its databases\\u2019 relevance.\\n\\n[![Image 5: What is Infostealer Malware?
