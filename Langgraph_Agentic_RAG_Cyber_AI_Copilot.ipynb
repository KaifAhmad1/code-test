            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.   Nearly all files are digitally signed by of “Foshan Yongqiheng Trading Co., Ltd.” The metadata for each file—including copyright, product, description, internal name, and comments—reflects the name under which it was downloaded. Notably, the signing date aligns with the download date.    Other samples are signed by “Langfang Alkem Material Technology Co., Ltd.”, including those with the following hashes:   42c1550b035353ae529e98304f89bf6065647833e582d08f0228185b493d0022 8d911ef72bdb4ec5b99b7548c0c89ffc8639068834a5e2b684c9d78504550927 92d2488e401d24a4bfc1598d813bc53af5c225769efedf0c7e5e4083623f4486 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 aa25a7c2520da54ba2045a21de252632c93f8eae06e031091ab908dca4eadf45    The only file lacking a digital signature in the list shown above is 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 Regarding the tayakay[.]com domain, when a user visits the site that is embedded with tayakay[.]com JS script, it constructs a query parameter containing victim information – such as device name, IP address and others – to send to the js.php endpoint.   By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

One victim browsed for websites to watch sports, and the other searched for a movie. In both incidents, the victim was redirected to a malicious URL that prompted them to verify they were human by completing the actions shown in Figure 1.

Multiple third-party reports describe similar activity. Orange Cyberdefense encountered campaigns in France in May and June 2024. In September, GitHub-themed phishing messages reportedly directed victims to a site that used the fake verification to deploy the LummaC2 infostealer.\n",
            "In 2023, CTU researchers warned about the growing threat from infostealers. Threat actors regularly use infostealers to obtain credentials for a wide range of online services and corporate networks. The criminals then sell this access in  underground marketplaces or use the access to conduct attacks such as phishing hotel customers. CTU analysis of underground activity related to the September 2024 incident response engagements revealed that credentials collected from victims of the fake human verification prompt were published to Russian Market within days of collection.\n",
            "CTU researchers recommend that organizations implement policies restricting employees from using corporate systems to browse for streaming services or risky content. Organizations should also conduct regular social engineering training that incorporates up-to-date threat intelligence on the latest techniques. Using web proxies to limit access to potentially malicious web pages could mitigate this threat.\n",

            "Text: Executive Summary\n",
            "We recently discovered a novel version of the RomCom malware family called SnipBot and, for the first time, show post-infection activity from the attacker on a victim system. This new strain makes use of new tricks and unique code obfuscation methods in addition to those seen in previous versions of RomCom 3.0 and PEAPOD (RomCom 4.0).\n",
            "In early April, our sandbox Advanced WildFire discovered an unusual DLL module that turned out to be part of a broader tool set called SnipBot. By examining the malware sample and using Cortex XDR telemetry data, we were able to reconstruct the infection chain and the attacker's subsequent actions.\n",
            "We also discovered more related malware strains dating back to December 2023. Although the aim of the attacker is unknown, the behavior we observed indicates an attempt to pivot through the victim's network and exfiltrate certain files.\n",
            "SnipBot gives the attacker the ability to execute commands and download additional modules onto a victim's system. It is a new version of the RomCom malware that is mainly based on RomCom 3.0. However, it also contains techniques seen in its offshoot PEAPOD called RomCom 4.0 by Trend Micro. Therefore, we’ve assigned it version 5.0.\n",
            "This threat operates in several stages, with the initial downloader always being an executable, followed by further EXEs or DLLs. The downloader we observed was consistently signed with a valid code signing certificate that the threat actor likely obtained either through certificate theft or fraud to purchase a new certificate, while subsequent modules were unsigned.\n",
            "In collaboration with Sophos, which initially found this new RomCom version in February during an incident, we investigated the malware's capabilities and gathered some knowledge about the attackers' activity on a victim’s system.\n",
            "Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the SnipBot malware through products like Cortex and Advanced WildFire, with its different memory analysis features. Advanced WildFire classifies the SnipBot malware samples in this article as malicious. Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security classify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious.\n",

            "  Malware Background\n",
            " RomCom RAT is a malware family that has evolved over the years to include different features and attack methods. The threat actor using RomCom has been active since at least 2022. They engage in ransomware, extortion and targeted credential gathering, likely to support intelligence-gathering operations. RomCom has made multiple advancements, leading to its newest iteration called SnipBot, which employs new commands and evasion techniques.\n",
            "The SnipBot variant of RomCom leverages a basic set of features that allows the attacker to run commands on a victim's system and download additional modules. The initial payload is always either an executable downloader masked as a PDF file or an actual PDF file sent to the victim in an email that leads to an executable.\n",
            "The earliest initial sample of SnipBot we found was a PDF file that shows distorted text that states a font is missing that’s needed to show it correctly. If the victim clicks on the contained link that’s purported to download and install the font package, they will instead download the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "SnipBot consists of several stages where the initial downloader is always an executable file and the remaining payloads are either EXEs or DLLs. The downloader is always signed with a legitimate and valid code signing certificate. We don’t know how the threat actors obtain these certificates, but it’s likely they steal them or gain them by fraud. Subsequent modules were not signed.\n",
            "  Email Infection Vector\n",
            "By reviewing Cortex XDR telemetry data and reverse engineering the initial sample, we were able to recreate the whole infection chain. The initial infection vector in our case was an email that contained a link that redirects twice to the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows the chain of URLs from the initial one contained in the email to the final SnipBot downloader file link. The attacker registered the domains and . The website is a legitimate file sharing service with a set hosting period of three days.\n",
            " Figure 1. URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "We discovered another chain of links that was likely used by the same attacker to deliver a similar SnipBot downloader variant. The distinct initial domain and the similar downloader file name imply this was part of a campaign targeting multiple victims.\n",
            "Figure 2 shows another chain of URLs used in another attack. The attacker created the domain ; it is not a legitimate file sharing service.\n",
            " Figure 2. Different URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "  SnipBot Malware\n",
            "Figure 3 shows the infection chain of the different SnipBot stages. The initial downloader is a 64-bit Windows executable (SHA256: ) disguised as a PDF file. It is signed with a presumably stolen or spoofed certificate from , which is a company located in Denmark.\n",
            " Figure 3. SnipBot execution flow from the initial EXE downloader to the main bot file (icon sources). \n",
            "This downloader uses two simple yet effective anti-sandbox tricks. The first one checks for the original file name by comparing the hashed process name against a hard-coded value. The second one checks whether there are at least 100 entries in the registry key, which is usually the case on a regular user’s system but less likely to be the case in a sandbox system.\n",

            " Figure 4. registry key of a typical Windows system. \n",
            "The downloader is also obfuscated with a window message-based control-flow obfuscation algorithm. The malware code is split up into multiple unordered blocks that are triggered by custom window messages.\n",
            "To accomplish this, a window is created that has a callback message that contains these code blocks. The window message queue is used to call each block in its original order.\n",
            "The first message block is triggered by sending the initial message and then each block sends the next message when it’s done. Additionally, each block can also send nested messages, which makes it even more challenging to follow the execution flow.\n",
            " \n",
            "Most of the strings, such as the command and control (C2) domain name and all the names of dynamically resolved API functions, are encrypted. The threat actor likely did this to prevent easy static detection, thus making malware analysis more time-consuming.\n",
            "Upon execution, the downloader contacts the first C2 domain and tries to get a PDF file and the first payload. We couldn’t recover the original downloaded first payload, but for an unknown reason, the attacker later downloaded the same payload with different configuration data and started it manually. We were able to obtain this file and could continue our analysis.\n",
            "The threat downloads the PDF to the local user’s temporary folder with a random name before opening it. The first payload is a DLL file (internally named ) that the threat executes in memory. It has an exported function named that contains its malicious code.\n",
            "This DLL file’s purpose is to download the next stage COM DLL named from the second C2 and inject it into Explorer. For this, it uses COM hijacking to register the file as the thumbnail cache library in the registry hive of the current user.\n",
            "When restarting , the DLL gets loaded into its address space and executed. While this is a reliable method of loading a payload into Explorer, forcing it to terminate can result in a crash, as it did on the victim's machine.\n",

This type of malware can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data from compromised computers and networks. Infostealers can be installed on a computer or device via phishing attacks, infected websites, and malicious software downloads. Once installed, they can execute and exit very quickly; many infostealers finish collecting and transmitting stolen data within several seconds to a minute of total runtime. The data is then packaged and sold as logs. Threat actors could use stolen credentials in these logs to gain unauthorized access to enterprise networks via remote access services such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA). This unauthorized access can result in the exfiltration of sensitive data or the deployment of ransomware, which can cause significant financial loss and reputational damage. Although the name 'infostealer' implies data theft, this malware has evolved over time to include deployment of additional tools and malware.\\n\\nUnderground forums and marketplaces\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealers are often sold as a monthly subscription service. The price can range from $50 to over $1,000 USD per month for access to a stealer command and control (C2) server operated by the developer. The service often features a range of support functions, including multiple ways to view, download, and share stolen data. Self-hosted stealer C2 servers are also available and are usually sold for a flat fee.\\n\\nUnderground forums provide a shared space for threat actors to discuss ongoing projects, request new features, and provide malware reviews. They also offer a marketplace to advertise new and existing stealers. Underground forums such as XSS . is and exploit . in are popular with threat actors involved in the development and deployment of infostealers.\\n\\nThese forums consist of subforums and sections that host a range of topics. They also contain administrative areas to control announcements, sales, and memberships. Many underground forums have a dedicated marketplace and enforce stringent rules to sell illegal products such as infostealers. Larger, high-profile forums offer an escrow service to mediate transactions between vendors and customers, building trust in the marketplace and providing a degree of control over interactions.\\n\\nStealer logs are available from underground forums, marketplaces, and other online platforms that cater to threat actors interested in obtaining credentials, financial information, personal data, banking details, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive, secret, or valuable information. These marketplaces are often only accessible through Tor or the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) anonymity services and usually have strict rules and regulations regarding the types of information that can be traded. The offerings are typically only accessible to members who have been approved by the marketplace's administrators or who pay an entry fee. Some marketplaces only sell infostealer logs and have built their infrastructure to facilitate these transactions. Other forums offer many illicit wares for sale and have sections that include logs obtained from infostealers.\\n\\nA burgeoning market also exists for after-action tools. Infostealers can lower the bar for entry to cybercrime, but the uninitiated can find the logs to be challenging to parse. Multiple vendors sell tools to assist in log parsing, enabling cybercriminals to extract data of interest from the raw logs.\\n\\n### Russian Market\\n\\nRussian Market is by far the biggest underground marketplace for infostealer logs, and it has ties to the now-defunct Amigos Marketplace. As of this publication, Russian Market offers over five million logs for sale, which is roughly ten times more than its nearest rival. Historically, the marketplace predominantly sold logs obtained through five infostealers: RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, Taurus, and AZORult. As of late February 2023, it stopped carrying Taurus and AZORult logs. Since December 2022, researchers observed [RisePRO](https://flashpoint.io/blog/risepro-stealer-and-pay-per-install-malware-privateloader/) infostealer logs for sale through the marketplace, although total offerings remain low. Table 1 lists the number of infostealer logs for sale on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023.\\n\\nStealer\\n\\nNumber of available logs\\n\\nRaccoon\\n\\n2,114,549\\n\\nVidar\\n\\n1,816,800\\n\\nRedLine\\n\\n1,415,458\\n\\nRisePRO\\n\\n3,833\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n5,350,640\\n\\n_Table 1. Number of infostealer logs available for purchase on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023._\\n\\nIn October 2022, Russian Market changed its operating model to allow users to preorder credentials (see Figure 1). This feature requires that buyers deposit $1,000 USD into the site's escrow system. Buyers can then request credentials based on a domain name (from a specific organization) or a 'mask' (from a specific application). Although there are no guarantees that preorders will be fulfilled, this feature could lead to specific targeting of organizations and sectors rather than relying just on opportunistic attacks.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-01.png)  \\n_Figure 1. Russian Market interface for preorder logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Genesis Market\\n\\nGenesis Market is an invitation-only marketplace that specializes in the sale of bots rather than logs. Bots are computers that were infected with infostealer malware to steal information and the browser fingerprint from a victim's web browser. The browser fingerprint can be used to impersonate the victim and access the victim's bank accounts, take over accounts, and make fraudulent purchases. A threat actor who purchases a bot has exclusive access to the data, including updates of the victim's data from the infected device.\\n\\nGenesis Market provides a custom browser plugin to customers and distinguishes itself among the competition by including more automation for site users. These features effectively render the bots as logs, removing the need to manually parse details and lowering the technical bar to entry. As of February 2023, Genesis Market listed over 450,000 bots from nearly every country (see Figure 2).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-02.png)  \\n_Figure 2. Number of available bots for sale on Genesis Market as of February 2023. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nOn April 4, 2023, Genesis Market was the target of a coordinated international [law enforcement action](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) led by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite the arrests of multiple users and the takedown of 11 domains, Operation Cookie Monster did not completely shutter the marketplace. As of this publication, the Tor version of Genesis Market remains operational. Logs have been added for sale since the takedown, albeit at a slower rate than usual.\\n\\n### 2easy\\n\\nThe 2easy marketplace has rapidly grown since it was established in 2018. Like Genesis Market, 2easy is automated, allowing buyers to add money to wallets and purchase logs without directly interacting with the seller. Unlike other sites, 2easy does not provide samples or previews. However, logs are [reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/2easy-now-a-significant-dark-web-marketplace-for-stolen-data/) less expensive than those on Genesis Market and Russian Market.\\n\\nThreat actors who purchase logs through the 2easy marketplace receive an archive file from the selected bot. The file's content depends on the stealer and its unique capabilities. RedLine has historically been the favorite infostealer for threat actors selling logs through 2easy, but the marketplace also sells Raccoon, Vidar, and AZORult logs. As of February 2023, 2easy offered over 750,000 logs for sale (see Figure 3).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-03.png)  \\n_Figure 3. Logs for sale on the 2easy marketplace. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nTelegram\\n--------\\n\\nAs demonstrated by the April 2023 Genesis Market takedown, one of the risks to sellers using traditional forums and marketplaces is the threat of law enforcement action. Another example was RaidForums, which was established in 2015 and became one of the most popular criminal marketplaces offering credentials and infostealers. In 2022, a coordinated international law enforcement investigation dubbed [Operation TOURNIQUET](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-hacker-forums-taken-down) resulted in the seizure of three domains and the arrest of RaidForums's founder and chief administrator. In addition, several cybercrime forums were [breached](https://www.securityweek.com/someone-hacking-cybercrime-forums-and-leaking-user-data/) in 2021 and their user data was stolen and either leaked or sold online. These takedowns and breaches undermine the security and integrity of the platforms and can degrade sellers' confidence in the anonymity offered by the forums. As a result, many cybercriminals use the Telegram messaging platform to advertise their services.\\n\\nTelegram is a multi-platform messaging service that has an estimated [700 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/234038/telegram-messenger-mau-users/) monthly users. Benefits of this platform for cybercriminals include its focus on privacy, encryption, and an open-source application programming interface (API) that allows 'unofficial clients' (alternative messaging apps that use Telegram's API) to communicate with the official app and web interface. The end-to-end encryption and support for private and anonymous channels are ideal for selling and trading stolen data and information. Telegram users can subscribe to channels on which owners can post content, or they can become members of groups and participate in discussions. Cybercriminals use these channels and groups to sell infostealers such as [Titan Stealer](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/titan-stealer-telegram-malware-campaign). Some channels are hidden and require specific invitations or permissions to access. There has [reportedly](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/positive-technologies-cybercrime-market-in-telegram-is-growing/) been a significant increase in the use of Telegram to sell illicit goods and services. Over 120,000 messages were published across more than 300 Telegram public channels and groups between the beginning of 2019 and the second quarter of 2022. RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan, Oski Stealer, and Loki Stealer are prominently represented on Telegram. [RaccoonV2](https://www.esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-raccoon-stealer-v2-0) operators extensively use Telegram for announcements, business discussions, and reporting stolen data.\\n\\nDespite the simplicity of selling goods over Telegram, it remains more popular for selling illicit goods such as drugs rather than for selling malware due to its primary function as a messaging platform. This limitation makes it difficult for sellers to migrate from traditional underground forums and marketplaces that feature advanced search capabilities and a way for sellers to build reputation, which is important when establishing trust with buyers. CTU\\u2122 researchers have observed scammers on Telegram mimicking real threat actors by creating fake profiles based on listings from forums such as Breached. This lack of reputation status and the prevalence of scammers is likely to undermine trust, preventing threat actors from fully adopting Telegram.\\n\\nInfostealer variants\\n--------------------\\n\\nInfostealers rose to prominence in 2006 with the [ZeuS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/zeus) trojan, which targeted online banking credentials. After the ZeuS source code was [leaked](https://www.theregister.com/2011/03/23/zeus_source_code_sale/) in March 2011, the creation of multiple variants boosted the popularity of this type of malware and inspired the development of infostealers with increasingly sophisticated capabilities. Some infostealers can be tailored or customized for specific targets and goals. For example, [LokiBot](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-266a) has been prominent since 2016 and was one of the first infostealers that targeted the Android operating system. The [Ducktail](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-php-variant-ducktail-infostealer-targeting-facebook-business-accounts) infostealer was first observed in 2022 and specifically targeted Facebook business accounts. Infostealers such as [BHUNT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bhunt-malware-targets-your-crypto-wallets-and-passwords/) specialize in stealing cryptocurrency, while state-sponsored threat groups such as [IRON TILDEN](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/iron-tilden) use custom versions to conduct espionage.\\n\\nCTU researchers analyzed the Russian Market marketplace to understand each infostealer's properties and capabilities. The table in the [Appendix](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-growing-threat-from-infostealers#appendix) compares features of the most common infostealers in 2022 but may not be a comprehensive view. Much of the information related to targeted browser extensions and applications is only found through the infostealer configurations. These configurations specify what information to extract from a compromised system, but they frequently change.\\n\\n### RedLine\\n\\nRedLine emerged in March 2020, and its logs are the best seller on Russian Market. RedLine is sold standalone or as a subscription. As of March 2023, standalone copies (the 'PRO' version) were advertised on Telegram for $900 USD, with subscriptions available for $150 per month or $400 for three months (see Figure 4). This malware steals information from web browsers, including saved credentials, autocomplete data, credit card information, and cryptocurrency wallets. While running on an infected system, RedLine takes a system inventory of the username, location data, hardware configuration, and installed security software.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-04.png)  \\n_Figure 4. RedLine Telegram channel listing prices and deals. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRedLine is distributed via [cracked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking) games, applications, and services, as well as via phishing campaigns and malicious ads. CTU researchers have observed multiple instances of threat actors using malicious Microsoft OneNote files to deliver RedLine. RedLine has also been observed using YouTube for [self-propagation](https://securelist.com/self-spreading-stealer-attacks-gamers-via-youtube/107407/) and has been linked by CTU researchers to SM Viewbot malware. SM Viewbot promotes YouTube videos to lure users who are searching for cracked software. Victims who download installers advertised in the video descriptions may infect their systems with infostealers.\\n\\nRedLine's execution process is straightforward. Once executed, the malware decodes XOR-encoded data such as the C2 server IP address and a unique ID. After the decoding process, RedLine requests configuration data from the C2 server, which instructs RedLine on what information to collect from the compromised system. Information related to the configuration data is then collected from the compromised system, converted into XML format, and transmitted to the C2 server via a Simple Object Access Protocol ([SOAP](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_soap.asp)) message.\\n\\n### Raccoon\\n\\nThe original Raccoon Stealer emerged in 2019. It operated as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model and was advertised on underground forums. The cost was $75 USD per week or $200 per month. It did not include a distribution mechanism, so customers had to devise a method to install the infostealer on compromised systems. The Raccoon Stealer panel was hosted on a Tor site.\\n\\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the threat actors responsible for Raccoon Stealer announced that they were [shutting down](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/raccoon-stealer-malware-suspends-operations-due-to-war-in-ukraine/) their operations, implying that a group member had died. However, the threat actors released a new version of the malware named RaccoonV2 in May 2022 (see Figure 5). While Raccoon Stealer and RaccoonV2 share similar functionality, CTU analysis confirms that RaccoonV2 represents a significant rewrite of the malware.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-05.png)  \\n_Figure 5. Raccoon Stealer Telegram channel giving details of the new build. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRaccoonV2 remains under active development as of this publication. The developers encoded more of the code strings in later versions and changed the encoding method, moving from Base64 to XOR. They continually alter elements of the malware to improve defense evasion, including changes to the User-Agents and mutexes, presumably to circumvent indicator-based detections. To hinder static and dynamic analysis, updates included intermixing chunks of code with thousands of bytes of opcodes from superfluous Windows API function calls.\\n\\nThe RaccoonV2 infostealer obtains its configuration file from a hard-coded C2 server. This file specifies what data the malware should steal (e.g., password files, credit card information, web browser data, email messages, cryptocurrency wallets, browser cookies). This data is stored as individual files in the %APPDATA%\\\\\\\\LocalLow directory before it is sent to the malware C2 server via an HTTP POST request.\\n\\nRaccoonV2 has occasionally been deployed alongside other infostealers such as RedLine. It has been [observed](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/464621/0/html) downloading and executing malware such as SmokeLoader, cryptocurrency wallet hijackers, Amadey, Remcos, AZORult, Allcome Clipper, SystemBC, and cryptocurrency miners.\\n\\n### Vidar\\n\\nVidar primarily operates as an infostealer but has also been used to deploy ransomware. The malware was first observed in 2019 during a prolific malvertising [campaign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/01/vidar-gandcrab-stealer-and-ransomware-combo-observed-in-the-wild) where threat actors used the Fallout exploit kit to distribute Vidar and GandCrab as secondary payloads. Vidar is sold on underground forums and Telegram channels (see Figure 6) as a standalone product, usually for between $130 USD per week to $750 for three months. Vidar provides an admin panel that lets customers configure the malware and monitor infections (see Figure 7).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-06.png)  \\n_Figure 6. Vidar Telegram channel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-07.png)  \\n_Figure 7. Vidar infostealer admin panel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nVidar is a Windows-based stealer that is written in C++ and based on the Arkei stealer. It steals system data such as machine ID, operating system, computer name, display resolution, keyboard language, hardware information, network information, and a list of installed software. Vidar can extract browser artifacts, the contents of some cryptocurrency wallets, PayPal data, session data, and screenshots.\\n\\nIn addition to stealing sensitive data, Vidar can deliver secondary payloads such as the SystemBC proxy malware. Because Vidar is available to any paying threat actor, the delivery method varies and may include phishing emails or pirated software.\\n\\nIn early 2022, CTU researchers observed Vidar creating profiles on the Mastodon social networking platform to obtain and post C2 IP addresses. The Mastodon sites used by Vidar have thousands of members, and it is unlikely that the threat actors manage or control the infrastructure. Vidar verifies that the compromised system is not located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by checking the computer language and keyboard settings. It then contacts the C2 server, which responds with the malware configuration. Vidar exfiltrates host and system information from infected devices and sends the data to the C2 server via HTTP form data POST requests.\\n\\n### Taurus\\n\\nThe 'Taurus Project,' as the infostealer was named by its developers, was first observed in the second quarter of 2020. It is the fourth-most prolific stealer on Russian Market, even though it has been inactive since late 2021. Taurus was primarily advertised on Russian-language forums and will not execute within CIS countries. There are [indications](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/threat-intelligence-report-project-taurus-infostealer-follows-in-predator-the-thiefs-footprints.pdf) that the group responsible for this malware was also responsible for the 'Predator the Thief' infostealer, either directly or through the sale of the original software to a third party. Taurus can steal VPN credentials, social media details, cryptocurrency credentials; take screenshots of the victim's desktop; and exfiltrate the system's software installation and configuration information. This data can be used to further exploit the compromised system. Taurus includes a dashboard that lets threat actors monitor infections by geographic region and customize the malware configuration to specify targeted information.\\n\\nTaurus was predominantly distributed via spam emails containing a malicious attachment. Opening the attached document prompts the victim to enable macros, which then executes a PowerShell script that initiates the download of additional payloads. Stolen data is exfiltrated as a ZIP file to a C2 server whose URL is built at runtime. Figure 8 shows the infection process.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-08.png)  \\n_Figure 8. Infection process for the Taurus infostealer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Rhadamanthys\\n\\nThe Rhadamanthys infostealer was first observed in the third quarter of 2022. It quickly established its reputation on underground forums due to the active development and deployment of user-friendly features that align with market demands. Rhadamanthys targets a wide range of applications, wallets, and user data on an infected device. The developers appear receptive to suggestions for regular updates and enhancements (see Figure 9). Rhadamanthys operates using a MaaS model and has been observed using phishing emails and Google Ads as the initial infection vector.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-09.png)  \\n_Figure 9. Forum post announcing Rhadamanthys updates. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nCTU researchers observed a threat actor named \\\"kingcrete2022\\\" advertising Rhadamanthys in September 2022 for $250 USD for 30 days or $550 for 90 days, payable in Monero or Bitcoin. In November 2022, a threat actor named 'Kingcrete' uploaded [two videos](https://vimeo.com/user185512701) to Vimeo. One video was an overview of the 'v0.3.2 updates.' The second video was named 'Wallter Crack and Customized Dictionaries' and showed how the infostealer targets cryptocurrency wallets. Both videos show details of the Rhadamanthys admin panel and a walkthrough of how it is used.\\n\\nRhadamanthys is written in C++. It evades detection by operating in system memory and by creating a mutex to ensure that only one instance is running. It uses the Al-Khaser anti-analysis tool to detect and avoid running in researcher sandboxes and virtual machines (VMs). Rhadamanthys is custom-packed with several stages that include dropping a custom loader DLL that decodes and executes an encoded payload via a command-line argument. The custom loader executes shellcode in a novel way by abusing the callback mechanism of the Windows CryptEnumOIDInfo() function and masquerades as a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer running the PrintUIEntry export (see Figure 10).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-10.png)  \\n_Figure 10. Example of Rhadamanthys masquerading as an NSIS installer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRhadamanthys decodes the C2 URL used for initial communication using a generated 128-byte XOR key. The configuration file it receives from the C2 server is disguised as a JFIF image via [steganography](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/01/12/rhadamanthys-new-stealer-spreading-through-google-ads/). The infostealer uses the [WebSocket](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2023/01/03/index.html) protocol to encrypt post-infection traffic, which includes stolen and exfiltrated data. Rhadamanthys can also be configured to run arbitrary executables.\\n\\n### State-sponsored stealers\\n\\nInfostealers are not exclusively used by cybercriminals. Because infostealers can discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, they are commonly and effectively used by state-sponsored threat groups that focus on cyberespionage operations. During the conflict in Ukraine, Russian threat actors deployed the [Graphiron](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/new-infostealer-discovered-russia/) infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. This infostealer is similar to the [GraphSteel](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/spear-phish-ukrainian-entities) malware previously used against Ukraine but includes enhanced capabilities. Graphiron is Go-based malware that can steal system and application data, screenshots, account credentials, and private keys. It consists of a downloader and a secondary information-stealing payload. The downloader checks for various security software and malware analysis tools before downloading the payload. Graphiron uses AES encryption with hard-coded keys to communicate with the C2 server through port 443.\\n\\nChinese state-sponsored threat groups have also been observed using infostealers in pursuit of their objectives. Reports of a 2022 espionage campaign targeting various government and public entities in Asia identified a custom [Infostealer.Logdatter](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/espionage-asia-governments) infostealer that logged keystrokes, captured screenshots, stole clipboard data, downloaded files, injected code, and both connected to and queried SQL databases. This campaign has been attributed to the [BRONZE ATLAS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-atlas) threat group.\\n\\nThe infostealer ecosystem\\n-------------------------\\n\\nMuch like the general cybercriminal ecosystem, the successful development and deployment of infostealers relies on individuals with a broad range of skills, roles, and responsibilities. These individuals include developers, initial access brokers (IABs), and customers (see Figure 11). The rise of MaaS operations has lowered the technical barrier to entry into cybercrime. It has also fostered innovation among developers as they improve their products and appeal to a broad audience of potential customers on underground forums and marketplaces.\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-11.png)  \\n_Figure 11. An overview of roles and relationships in the infostealer ecosystem. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Developers\\n\\nMalware developers are responsible for writing and maintaining the code that will be packaged and sold on underground forums, typically to IABs. With MaaS being the most common business model in the infostealer marketplace, developers can dedicate more time and effort to ensuring their malware contains a range of features, taking feedback from users, and iterating the malware to constantly evolve and improve. Forums allow customers to leave feedback, enhancing the seller's reputation and potentially increasing the popularity of the malware.\\n\\n### Initial access brokers\\n\\nIABs are individuals or groups that rent access to tools from MaaS operators on underground forums and marketplaces. They then deploy these infostealers via phishing or malicious ad campaigns to infect systems. These infostealers steal data from the compromised system and exfiltrate it to a C2 server. This stolen data, typically including credentials for services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), VPNs, email accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets, is then sold to threat actors who use it for malicious purposes.\\n\\n### Customers\\n\\nDue to diverse types of data that infostealers can obtain from a compromised system, threat actors often purchase the data for a wide range of purposes. Financially motivated cybercriminals may purchase credentials for cryptocurrency wallets, online banking, or other financial services and abuse them to make fraudulent withdrawals or transactions. Ransomware groups commonly seek infostealer logs, as credentials for RDP, VPNs, and corporate accounts can provide initial access into enterprises prior to data exfiltration and encryption. The value of infostealers to ransomware groups has increased with the success of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and the growth of 'hack-and-leak' sites. For example, the LockBit ransomware operators [reportedly](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1587887149411536896) offered to purchase the Raccoon Stealer source code.\\n\\n### Specialist log parsers\\n\\nLog marketplaces such as Genesis Market have built-in parsing as a browser extension, which allows customers to seamlessly access device fingerprints and victim data. Other marketplaces like Russian Market and 2easy sell raw logs that require parsing to interpret and use the content. Parsing infostealer logs purchased from a underground marketplace can be a complex task, as the logs are often in various formats and contain a large amount of data. This challenge has created a secondary market for individuals selling parser tools to customers who have either deployed the infostealers and want to sell structured data or to buyers in possession of bulk raw logs (see Figures 12 and 13).\\n\\n![](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-12.png)  \\n_Figure 12.

Threat actor selling a parser for large batches of stealer logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn 2022, stolen credentials [featured heavily](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-irs-learning-from-incident-response-team-2022-year-in-review) in Secureworks incident response engagements. Infostealer malware poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations. Its ability to steal sensitive information such as passwords and financial information has far-reaching consequences for victims. This type of malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult for victims to detect and remove. Additionally, the evolution of criminal marketplaces allows relatively low-skilled threat actors to access tools with advanced capabilities to attack many victims.\\n\\nThe migration to remote work driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and sustained post-pandemic exposes users and organizations to even greater risk from infostealers. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies that let users access corporate assets from infected personal devices can lead to compromises of corporate systems.\\n\\nTo mitigate this threat, individuals and organizations must take proactive steps to secure their systems. These steps include keeping software up to date, using strong and unique passwords that must not be stored in web browsers, and being wary of suspicious emails or downloads. It is also crucial to invest in security solutions that can detect and block infostealer malware. By taking these actions, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of compromise.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\nAbrams, Lawrence. \\u201cRaccoon Stealer malware suspends operations due to war in Ukraine.\\u201d Bleeping Computer.
