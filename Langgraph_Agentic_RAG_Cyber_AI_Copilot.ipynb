Soon it was blocked for falling foul of the Telegram terms of service. The group stayed off the radar for several months, but as we investigated a late June 2024 attack, we found that it employed techniques identical to those of Twelve and relied on C2 servers linked to the threat actor. We are therefore confident that the group is still active and will probably soon resurface. This article uses the Unified Kill Chain methodology to analyze the attackers’ actions.\n",
            "About Twelve\n",
            "The group was formed in April 2023 in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and has attacked Russian government organizations ever since.\n",
            "The threat actor specializes in encrypting and then deleting victims’ data, which seriously complicates efforts to recover the IT environment. This suggests that their main goal is inflicting as much damage as possible. When attacking, the group aims to reach critical infrastructure, but they do not always succeed. In addition, Twelve exfiltrates sensitive information from its victims’ systems and posts it on its Telegram channel.\n",
            "Interestingly, Twelve shares infrastructure, utilities and techniques (TTPs) with the DARKSTAR ransomware group, formerly known as Shadow or COMET, which suggests that the two belong to the same syndicate or activity cluster. At the same time, whereas Twelve’s actions are clearly hacktivist in nature, DARKSTAR sticks to the classic double extortion pattern. This variation of objectives within the syndicate underscores the complexity and diversity of modern cyberthreats.\n",

            "Resource Development\n",
            "As we analyzed the cyberattacks, we found that the threat actor relied exclusively on well-known and freely available tools. The tools frequently used by the group include Cobalt Strike, mimikatz, chisel, BloodHound, PowerView, adPEAS, CrackMapExec, Advanced IP Scanner and PsExec.\n",
            "Initial Access and Delivery\n",
            "In most of the attacks we are aware of, the adversary gained initial access to victims’ infrastructure through valid local or domain accounts, VPN or SSH certificates. After gaining access to the victim’s infrastructure, the attackers used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally.\n",
            "Most times, the attackers penetrated the target infrastructure via some of the victim’s contractors. To do this, they gained access to the contractor’s infrastructure and then used its certificate to connect to its customer’s VPN. Having obtained access to that, the adversary can connect to the customer’s systems via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then penetrate the customer’s infrastructure.\n",

            "Text: AUSTIN, Texas– A Ukrainian national pleaded guilty in federal court in Austin today to one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. According to court documents, Mark Sokolovsky, 28, conspired to operate the Raccoon Infostealer as a malware-as-a-service or “MaaS.” Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency. These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims. Raccoon Infostealer then stole personal data from victim computers, including log-in credentials, financial information, and other personal records. Stolen information was used to commit financial crimes or was sold to others on cybercrime forums. In March 2022, concurrent with Sokolovsky’s arrest by Dutch authorities, the FBI and law enforcement partners in Italy and the Netherlands dismantled the digital infrastructure supporting the Raccoon Infostealer, taking its then existing version offline. Sokolovsky was extradited to the United States from the Netherlands in February 2024 after being indicted for crimes related to fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. As part of the plea, he agreed to a forfeiture money judgment of $23,975 and restitution of at least $910,844.61. U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas made the announcement of the defendant’s plea.

            "Text: Infostealer attacks are becoming an increasingly serious threat. Over the past few years, infostealer malware has increasingly become the weapon of choice for cybercriminals as a low-hanging fruit tactic to carry out high-impact data breaches due to their simplicity, vast availability, and low cost. The Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Intelligence team recently discovered a new version of the SYS01 infostealer during our ongoing research of malicious activity on Facebook. With over 2.9 billion monthly active users and 200 million business accounts on Facebook, this infostealer poses a significant risk. In this campaign, hackers use malicious advertisements to steal account credentials to take over Facebook business and personal pages, as well as gain access to users' credentials, history, and cookies in web browsers. The captured information can include saved credit card info, passwords for accounts to other sites, and more. This can then lead to further rippling effects, including disruption of business operations and financial loss.  Global Director, SpiderLabs Threat Hunt Team, Trustwave.  Expanded Facebook User Targeting SYS01 represents a new wave of infostealer malware with more sophisticated capabilities and evasion techniques, making it a formidable threat. Since its emergence in March 2023, SYS01 has dramatically evolved. Initially distributed through Facebook advertisements related to adult content and gaming, this new version which has been operating since September 2023, now includes ads for AI-tools and Windows themes. This evolution advances SYS01’s appearance of legitimacy and extends its reach to target the general population, making it more challenging for users to identify and avoid malicious ads. As this malware continues to evolve and target a larger pool of potential victims, organizations should implement filtering systems to analyze ad content for signs of malware or malicious intent to help mitigate risks. It's also crucial for employees to improve their own ability to recognize spoofed ads and maintain good cybersecurity hygiene by staying informed about the latest trends and tools used by cybercriminals. The Adaptive Nature of SYS01 SYS01 can manipulate antivirus software configurations to avoid detection and maintain presence on infected systems for extended periods. This makes it much more challenging for traditional security solutions to detect the malware. With the ability to identify virtualized environments used by security researchers for malware analysis, SYS01 can further alter its behavior or halt execution to prevent discovery by security tools.   Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!   Not only can SYS01 manipulate security tools to evade detection, but its adaptability also allows it to continue to morph and adjust to increase effectiveness with each malicious ad campaign. Leveraging calculated A/B testing, SYS01 adapts and refines its ads to maximize engagement and click-through rates and repeats use of the more successful advertisements. Given the adaptive nature of SYS01, organizations should ensure they have host-based anti-malware tools to help detect and protect against malicious exploits. Security and IT teams can go a step further by keeping browsers and plugins up-to-date and configuring browsers and tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies to reduce the risk of session cookie theft of sensitive information. When prevention isn’t possible, audit controls can also help detect potential compromises. One Infostealer After Another As cybercriminals continue to innovate with their use of infostealers, maintaining vigilance and implementing robust security measures is critical. SYS01 is just one of many infostealer threats. Many of its tactics exhibit striking similarities to other infostealers, such as Rilide. Disguising itself as a legitimate Google Drive extension, Rilide targets Chromium-based browsers – such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera – leveraging Google Ads to carry out attacks that monitor browsing history and capture screenshots before injecting malicious scripts to withdraw funds from cryptocurrency exchanges. To protect against such threats, security leaders should enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across their organizations. This adds an extra layer of defense, making unauthorized access more difficult if and when users inadvertently click on malicious ads. Proactive monitoring with tools like endpoint detection and response, alongside MFA, enhances security by detecting anomalies and aggregating data across an organization’s IT infrastructure. A Call for Proactive Defense SYS01’s evolution and sophisticated capabilities underscore the growing threat posed by infostealers, particularly in its demonstrated ability to evade detection and continuously evolve. This flexibility highlights the need for cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of the curve to effectively anticipate and mitigate future threats. By investing in robust defenses, monitoring solutions, and proactive threat hunting, organizations can better safeguard against the rising risks of infostealers and protect their digital assets from potential harm.
