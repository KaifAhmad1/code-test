            "* Cisco Talos discovered a new information stealing campaign operated by a Vietnamese-speaking threat actor targeting government and education entities in Europe and Asia.\n",
            "* We discovered a new Python program called PXA Stealer that targets victims’ sensitive information, including credentials for various online accounts, VPN and FTP clients, financial information, browser cookies, and data from gaming software.\n",
            "* PXA Stealer has the capability to decrypt the victim’s browser master password and uses it to steal the stored credentials of various online accounts.\n",
            "* The attacker has used complex obfuscation techniques for the batch scripts used in this campaign.\n",
            "* We discovered the attacker selling credentials and tools in the Telegram channel “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” which is where the [CoralRaider](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/coralraider-targets-socialmedia-accounts/) adversary operates, but we are not sure if the attacker belongs to the CoralRaider threat group or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Victimology and targeted information\n",
            "The attacker is targeting the education sector in India and government organizations in European countries, including Sweden and Denmark, based on Talos telemetry data.\n",
            "The attacker’s motive is to steal the victim’s information, including credentials for various online accounts, browser login data, cookies, autofill information, credit card details, data from various cryptocurrency online and desktop wallets, data from installed VPN clients, gaming software accounts, chat messengers, password managers, and FTP clients.\n",
            "Attacker’s infrastructure\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker was hosting malicious scripts and the stealer program on a domain, tvdseo[.]com, in the directories “/file”, “/file/PXA/”, “/file/STC/”, and “/file/Adonis/”. The domain belongs to a Vietnamese professional search engine optimization (SEO) service provider; however, we are not certain whether the attacker has compromised the domain to host the malicious files or has subscribed to get legitimate access while still using it for their malicious purposes.\n",
            "We found that the attacker is using the Telegram bot for exfiltrating victims’ data. Our analysis of the payload, PXA Stealer, disclosed a few Telegram bot tokens and the chat IDs – controlled by the attacker.\n",

            "-4575205410\n",
            "Attacker’s underground activities\n",
            "We identified attacker’s Telegram account “Lone None,” which was hardcoded in the PXA Stealer program and analyzed various details of the account, including the icon of Vietnam’s national flag and a picture of the emblem for Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security, which aligns with our assessment that the attacker is of Vietnamese origin. Also, we found Vietnamese comments in the PXA Stealer program, which further strengthen our assessment.\n",
            "The attacker’s Telegram account has biography data that includes a link to a private antivirus checker website that allows users or buyers to assess the detection rate of a malware program. This website provides a platform for potential threat actors to evaluate the effectiveness and stealth capabilities of the malware before purchasing it, indicating a sophisticated level of service and professionalism in the threat actor's operations.\n",
            "We also discovered that the attacker is active in an underground Telegram channel, “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” mainly selling Facebook accounts, Zalo accounts, SIM cards, credentials, and money laundry data. Talos observed that this Vietnamese actor is also seen in the Telegram group in which the CoralRaider actor operates. However, we are not certain whether the actor is a member of the CoralRaider gang or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker is also promoting another underground Telegram channel, “Cú Black Ads – Dropship,\" by sharing a few automation tools to manage large numbers of user accounts in their channel and conducting the exchanging or selling of information related to social media accounts, proxy services, and a batch account creator tool.\n",
            "The tools shared by the attacker in the group are automated utilities designed to manage several user accounts. These tools include a Hotmail batch creation tool, an email mining tool, and a Hotmail cookie batch modification tool. The compressed packages provided by the threat actor often contain not only the executable files for these tools but also their source code, allowing users to modify them as needed.\n",
            "Hotmail batch creation tool from telegram channel.\n",
            "Hotmail cookie batch modification tool from telegram channel.\n",
            "We found that the attacker is not sharing all the tools for free, and some of them require users to send a unique key back to the Telegram channel administrator for software activation. This process ensures that only those who have been vetted or have paid for the tool can access its full functionality. We also discovered that these tools are distributed on other websites, such as aehack[.]com, highlighting that they are selling the tools. Additionally, a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBLueYeRugg) channel exists that provides tutorials on how to use these tools, further facilitating their widespread use and demonstrating the organized efforts to market and instruct potential users on their application.\n",
            "Infection Chain\n",
            "The attacker gains initial access by sending a phishing email with a ZIP file attachment, according to our telemetry data. The ZIP file contains a malicious loader executable file compiled in Rust language and a hidden folder called Photos. The hidden folder has other recurring folders, such as Documents and Images, that contain obfuscated Windows batch scripts and a decoy PDF document.\n",
            "When a victim extracts the attachment ZIP file, the hidden folder and the malicious Rust loader executable are dropped onto the victim machine. When the malicious Rust loader executable is run by the victim, it loads and executes multiple obfuscated batch scripts that are in the dropped hidden folders.\n",
            "We deobfuscated the Windows batch scripts using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), with each step in the process being crucial and requiring precise execution to achieve accurate deobfuscation. First, we employed regular expressions (regex) to filter out random characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z). These random strings ranged in length from six to nine characters and were enclosed within “%” symbols. Next, we filtered out the “^” symbols and removed any remaining uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z) as well as special characters “_,” /’(?),” “$,” “#,” and “[].” Finally, we eliminated the “%” symbols and we were able to successfully deobfuscate the scripts and reveal their PowerShell commands.\n",
            "Snippet of the o bfuscated batch script Snippet of the deobfuscated batch script\n",
            "The batch scripts execute PowerShell commands simultaneously, performing the following activities on the victim machine:\n",

The stealer accesses the master key file “Local State” located in the browser folder of the user’s profile directory, which contains the information of the encryption key used to encrypt the user data stored in the “Login Data” file, and decrypts it using the “CryptUnprotectData” function. This allows the attacker to gain access to the stored credentials and other sensitive browser information.\n",
            "Browser master key decryption function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer also attempts to decrypts the master key that is stored in the key4.db file. Key4.db is a database used by Firefox (and some other Mozilla-based browsers) to store encryption keys, particularly the master key that encrypts sensitive data, such as saved passwords. The “getKey” function of the stealer is designed to extract and decrypt keys from the key4.db file using either AES or 3DES encryption methods, depending on the encryption used in the stored key.\n",
            "Browser master key decryption function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer attempts to retrieve user profiles paths from the profiles.ini file of browser applications, including Mozilla Firefox, Pale Moon, SeaMonkey, Waterfox, Mercury, k-Melon, IceDragon, Cyberfox, and BlackHaw for further processing, such as extracting saved passwords or other user data.\n",
            "The stealer collects the victim’s login information from the browser’s login data file. The function “get_ch_login_data” of the stealer extracts login data, including URLs, usernames, and passwords, from the database “login_db”, which stores login information. The extracted login information is formatted into a string that includes the URL, username, decrypted password, browser, and profile.\n",
            "For each login entry in the browser login database, the function checks if the URL contains any important keywords that are hardcoded in the stealer program, and if a match is found, the login information is saved in a separate file named “Important_Logins.txt” located in the “Browsers Data” folder within the user’s profile temporary directory. The function saves all the results to “All_Passwords.txt” in the “Browsers Data” folder for other login data found in the database.\n",
            "Login credentials stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer executes another function, “get_ch_cookies”, to extract cookies from a specified browser's cookie database, decrypt them, and save the results to a file. First, it checks if the cookies database file exists in the specified profile directory and unlocks the cookies database file. The database file is then copied to the temporary folder and is processed by executing an SQL query to retrieve cookie information, including host key, name, path, encrypted value, expiration time, secure flag, and HTTP-only flag from the cookies database file.\n",
            "If any Facebook cookies are found, they are concatenated to a single string called \"fb_formatted\", and it calls another function, \"ADS_Checker()\", to check for ads based on the Facebook cookies, and the results are written to a file called \"Facebook_Cookies.txt”.

            "Browser cookie stealer JavaScript.\n",
            "Next, the stealer targets the victim’s credit card information stored in the browser database “webappsstore.sqlite”. The function extracts and decrypts saved credit card information from a browser's web data database. It checks if the cards database file \"cards_db\" exists and copies them to the user’s profile temporary folder. It executes a SQL query to retrieve credit card information including name on card, expiration month/year, encrypted card number, and date modified. Then it decrypts the encrypted card number using the function “decrypt_ch_value” with the help of the decrypted master key. It writes the cards’ information to a text file and names it after the browser and the profile. Finally, it gets the count of credit card information that was found and deletes the temporary copy of the “cards_db” file.\n",

Once the encrypted tokens are found, it decrypts them with the function “decrypt_dc_tokens()” using the extracted master key that was used to encrypt the tokens from the \"Local State\" file. Then, it validates the decrypted Discord tokens to check if it is a legitimate Discord token and stores it by associating it with the browser name. Besides searching for the encrypted tokens, the function also looks for unencrypted Discord tokens by searching strings that match the regular expression pattern \"[\\w-]{24}\\.[\\w-]{6}\\.[\\w-]{27}\" for standard tokens and \"mfa\\.[\\w-]{84}\" for multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens in \".log\" and \".ldb\" files in the levelDB directory of Discord applications or web browsers where the structured key-value data is stored in levelDB database format.\n",
            "Discord token stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",

            "Text: Since October 22, 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed Russian threat actor Midnight Blizzard sending a series of highly targeted spear-phishing emails to individuals in government, academia, defense, non-governmental organizations, and other sectors. This activity is ongoing, and Microsoft will continue to investigate and provide updates as available. Based on our investigation of previous Midnight Blizzard spear-phishing campaigns, we assess that the goal of this operation is likely intelligence collection. Microsoft is releasing this blog to notify the public and disrupt this threat actor activity. This blog provides context on these external spear-phishing attempts, which are common attack techniques and do not represent any new compromise of Microsoft.\n",
            "The spear-phishing emails in this campaign were sent to thousands of targets in over 100 organizations and contained a signed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configuration file that connected to an actor-controlled server. In some of the lures, the actor attempted to add credibility to their malicious messages by impersonating Microsoft employees. The threat actor also referenced other cloud providers in the phishing lures. \n",
            "While this campaign focuses on many of Midnight Blizzard’s usual targets, the use of a signed RDP configuration file to gain access to the targets’ devices represents a novel access vector for this actor. Overlapping activity has also been reported by the Government Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) under the designation UAC-0215 and also by Amazon.\n",
            " Midnight Blizzard is a Russian threat actor attributed by the United States and United Kingdom governments to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation, also known as the SVR. This threat actor is known to primarily target governments, diplomatic entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers, primarily in the United States and Europe. Its focus is to collect intelligence through longstanding and dedicated espionage of foreign interests that can be traced to early 2018. Its operations often involve compromise of valid accounts and, in some highly targeted cases, advanced techniques to compromise authentication mechanisms within an organization to expand access and evade detection.\n",
            "Midnight Blizzard is consistent and persistent in its operational targeting, and its objectives rarely change. It uses diverse initial access methods, including spear phishing, stolen credentials, supply chain attacks, compromise of on-premises environments to laterally move to the cloud, and leveraging service providers’ trust chain to gain access to downstream customers. Midnight Blizzard is known to use the Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) malware known as FOGGYWEB and MAGICWEB. Midnight Blizzard is identified by peer security vendors as APT29, UNC2452, and Cozy Bear.\n",
            "As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft is in the process of directly notifying customers that have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to secure their accounts. Strong anti-phishing measures will help to mitigate this threat. As part of our commitment to helping protect against cyber threats, we provide indicators of compromise (IOCs), hunting queries, detection details, and recommendations at the end of this post.\n",
            "On October 22, 2024, Microsoft identified a spear-phishing campaign in which Midnight Blizzard sent phishing emails to thousands of users in over 100 organizations. The emails were highly targeted, using social engineering lures relating to Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the concept of Zero Trust. The emails contained a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configuration file signed with a LetsEncrypt certificate. RDP configuration (.RDP) files summarize automatic settings and resource mappings that are established when a successful connection to an RDP server occurs. These configurations extend features and resources of the local system to a remote server, controlled by the actor.\n",
            "In this campaign, the malicious .RDP attachment contained several sensitive settings that would lead to significant information exposure. Once the target system was compromised, it connected to the actor-controlled server and bidirectionally mapped the targeted user’s local device’s resources to the server. Resources sent to the server may include, but are not limited to, all logical hard disks, clipboard contents, printers, connected peripheral devices, audio, and authentication features and facilities of the Windows operating system, including smart cards. This access could enable the threat actor to install malware on the target’s local drive(s) and mapped network share(s), particularly in AutoStart folders, or install additional tools such as remote access trojans (RATs) to maintain access when the RDP session is closed. The process of establishing an RDP connection to the actor-controlled system may also expose the credentials of the user signed in to the target system.\n",

            "RDP connection\n",
            "When the target user opened the .RDP attachment, an RDP connection was established to an actor-controlled system. The configuration of the RDP connection then allowed the actor-controlled system to discover and use information about the target system, including:\n",

            "Check Point, which attributed the campaign to a likely cybercrime group, said that it's possible the threat actors have utilized AI tools given the scale of the campaign and the variety of the lures and sender emails.\n",
            "\"The campaign's widespread and indiscriminate targeting of organizations across multiple regions suggests it was orchestrated by a financially motivated cybercrime group rather than a nation-state actor,\" it said. \"Its global reach, automated phishing tactics, and diverse lures demonstrate how attackers continuously evolve to improve their success rates.\"\n",

            "The findings come as Kaspersky shed light on a new \"full-featured crimeware bundle\" dubbed SteelFox that's propagated via forums posts, torrent trackers, and blogs, passing off as legitimate utilities like Foxit PDF Editor, JetBrains, and AutoCAD.\n",
            "The campaign, dating back to February 2023, has claimed victims across the world, particularly those located in Brazil, China, Russia, Mexico, UAE, Egypt, Algeria, Vietnam, India, and Sri Lanka. It has not been attributed to any known threat actor or group.\n",
            "\"Delivered via sophisticated execution chains including shellcoding, this threat abuses Windows services and drivers,\" security researcher Kirill Korchemny said. \"It also uses stealer malware to extract the victim's credit card data as well as details about the infected device.\"\n",
            "The starting point is a dropper app that impersonates cracked versions of popular software, which, when executed, asks for administrator access and drops a next-stage loader that, in turn, establishes persistence and launches the SteelFox DLL.\n",

            "The admin access is subsequently abused to create a service that runs an older version of WinRing0.sys, a hardware access library for Windows that's vulnerable to CVE-2020-14979 and CVE-2021-41285, thereby allowing the threat actor to obtain NT\\SYSTEM privileges.\n",
            "\"This driver is also a component of the XMRig miner, so it is utilized for mining purposes,\" Korchemny noted. \"After initializing the driver, the sample launches the miner. This represents a modified executable of XMRig with junk code fillers. It connects to a mining pool with hardcoded credentials.\"\n",
            "The miner, for its part, is downloaded from a GitHub repository, with the malware also initiating contact with a remote server over TLS version 1.3 to exfiltrate sensitive data from web browsers, such as cookies, credit card data, browsing history, and visited places, system metadata, installed software, and timezone, among others.\n",

            " Cisco Talos has observed an unknown threat actor conducting a phishing campaign targeting Facebook business and advertising account users in Taiwan.  The decoy email and fake PDF filenames are designed to impersonate a company's legal department, attempting to lure the victim into downloading and executing malware.  This campaign abuses Google's Appspot[.]com domains, a short URL and Dropbox service, to deliver an information stealer onto the target's machine to avoid network security product detections.  Talos also observed the threat actor using multiple techniques to evade antivirus detection and sandbox analysis, such as code obfuscation, shellcode encryption, hiding malicious code in resource data to expand the file size to over 700 MB, and embedding LummaC2 or Rhadamanthys information stealers into legitimate binaries.   Phishing email campaign targets Taiwan  Talos observed an unknown threat actor conducting a malicious phishing campaign targeting victims in Taiwan since at least July 2024. The campaign specifically targets victims whose Facebook accounts are used for business or advertising purposes.  The initial vector of the campaign is a phishing email containing a malware download link. The phishing email uses traditional Chinese in decoy templates and the fake PDF files, suggesting the target is likely traditional Chinese speakers. Some of the fake PDF filenames that we observed during our analysis are:   IMAGE COPYRIGHTED.exe  [Redacted] 的影片內容遭到侵犯版權.exe (translates to “[Redacted]'s video content has been copyright infringed.exe”)  版權侵權信息- [Redacted] Media Co Ltd.exe (translates to “Copyright Infringement Information - [Redacted] Media Co Ltd.exe”)  版權侵權信息- [Redacted] Media Group Inc.exe (translates to “Copyright Infringement Information - [Redacted] Media Group Inc.exe”)  版權侵權信息- [Redacted] Technology Group.exe (translates to “Copyright Infringement Information - [Redacted] Technology Group.exe”)  版權侵權信息- [Redacted] Co. Ltd.exe (translates to “Copyright Infringement Information - [Redacted] Co. Ltd.exe”)  [Redacted] Online -宣布侵權.exe (translates to “[Redacted] Online - declare infringement.exe”)   The decoy email and fake PDF filenames are designed to impersonate a company's legal department, attempting to lure the victim into downloading and executing malware. Another observation we found is that the fake PDF malware uses the names of well-known technology and media companies in Taiwan and Hong Kong. This provides strong evidence that the threat actor conducted thorough research before launching this campaign.  Additionally, we observed two phishing emails masquerading as notices from a well-known industrial motor manufacturer and a famous online shopping store in Taiwan. The emails claim that the company’s legal representatives have issued a notice to a Facebook page administrator alleging copyright infringement due to the unauthorized use of their images and videos for product promotion. The emails demand the removal of the infringing content within 24 hours, cessation of further use without written permission, and warn of potential legal action and compensation claims for non-compliance. Last but not least, with these two emails, we can easily identify that the threat actor uses the same template with minor modifications, such as changing the company name, legal department information, address, and website.    Phishing email impersonating a well-known industrial motor manufacturer.    Phishing email impersonating a famous online shopping store.  Attribution  Talos observed an unknown image printing EPS file within the encrypted archive, with the filename \"Support.\" Based on the file name and file size, it is likely that all encrypted archives we found on VirusTotal, which we have not been able to decrypt, contain the same EPS files inside. Pivoting off the EPS file metadata and its preview image on a search engine, we found an identical image with the same file name on a Vietnamese-language website. However, there is no strong evidence that it was created by an author from that region.    Support EPS file metadata.    The support EPS file preview image in this campaign (left) and the image we found from the internet (right).  Actor infrastructure  The threat actor is abusing Google's Appspot.com domains, a short URL and Dropbox service, to deliver an information stealer onto the target's machine. Appspot.com is a cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. When the victim clicks on the download link, it initially connects to Appspot.com, then redirects to a short URL created by a third-party service, and finally redirects to Dropbox to download the malicious archive. The actor is using the third-party data storage service as a download server to deceive network defenders.    Malware download link.  We also discovered that the actor is using multiple command and control (C2) domains in the campaign. The DNS requests for the domains during our analysis period are shown in the graph, indicating the campaign is ongoing.    C2 domain DNS requests.  Malware infection summary  The infection chain begins with a phishing email containing a malicious download link. When the victim downloads the malicious RAR file, they will need a specific password to extract it, revealing a fake PDF executable malware and an image printing file. Once the malware is decrypted and the fake PDF executable is run, it will execute the embedded LummaC2 or Rhadamanthys information stealer, which then collects the victim’s credentials and data, sending them back to the C2 server.    The malicious RAR file usually contains a fake PDF executable malware and an image printing file, but we observed a few malicious RAR files that contain an additional DLL file. However, without the correct password, we are not able to extract the malicious RAR file and analyze it.    The RAR file contains a fake PDF and an image printing file.    The RAR file contains a fake PDF, an image printing file, and additional DLL file.  The fake PDF executable malware variant was delivered as a payload in this campaign. This malware will embed LummaC2 or Rhadamanthys information stealers into legitimate binary and the legitimate binary including iMazing Converter, foobar2000, Punto Switcher, PDF Visual Repair, LedStatusApp, and PrivacyEraser. Below shows one of the file details of the fake PDF executable.    Fake PDF file detail information.  LummaC2 stealer and its loader   LummaC2 Stealer is a type of malware designed to exfiltrate sensitive information from compromised systems. It can target system details, web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. Written in C, this malware is sold on underground forums. To avoid detection and analysis, it employs various obfuscation methods. The malware connects to a C2 server to receive instructions and transmit the stolen data.  The loader for LummaC2 changes the execution flow of the binary malware, causing it to invoke an unknown library to execute the malicious code functions. This strategic modification complicates detection and analysis efforts. Once these malicious functions are invoked, the malware utilizes the CreateFileMappingA API to write the payload into a mapped memory block, effectively hiding it within the system's memory. After successfully mapping the payload, the malware then executes it.    Call to an unknown library to execute the malicious code functions.  When the malware begins executing the shellcode in memory, it first decrypts the second half of the program block, which contains part of the shellcode loader and the LummaC2 malware execution file. Once the decryption is complete, it will call the VirtualAllocate API to allocate a memory block, write the information stealer's execution file to that block, and then execute it.    Jump code to shellcode block. \n",
