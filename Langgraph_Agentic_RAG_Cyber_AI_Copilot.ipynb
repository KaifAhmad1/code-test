            "Variants of MYBOX-themed phishing emails have been recorded since late April 2024, with the early waves employing Japanese, South Korea, and U.S. domains for sender addresses.\n",

            "While these messages were ostensibly sent from domains such as \"mmbox[.]ru\" and \"ncloud[.]ru,\" further analysis has revealed that the threat actor leveraged a compromised email server belonging to Evangelia University (evangelia[.]edu) to send the messages using a PHP-based mailer service called Star.\n",
            "It's worth noting that Kimsuky's use of legitimate email tools like PHPMailer and Star was previously documented by enterprise security firm Proofpoint in November 2021.\n",

            "\"Recent months have seen a surge in mailings with lookalike email attachments in the form of a ZIP archive containing JScript scripts,\" security researcher Artem Ushkov said in a Monday analysis. \"The script files [are] disguised as requests and bids from potential customers or partners.\"\n",

            "There are indications that the campaign is the work of a threat actor known as TA569 (aka Gold Prelude, Mustard Tempest, and Purple Vallhund), which is known for operating the SocGholish (aka FakeUpdates) malware. This connection stems from overlaps in the NetSupport RAT license and configuration files used in respective activities.\n",

            "Executive Summary\n",
            "Beginning in early October, Rapid7 has observed a resurgence of activity related to the ongoing social engineering campaign being conducted by Black Basta ransomware operators. Rapid7 initially reported the discovery of the novel social engineering campaign back in May, 2024, followed by an update in August 2024, when the operators updated their tactics and malware payloads and began sending lures via Microsoft Teams. Now, the procedures followed by the threat actors in the early stages of the social engineering attacks have been refined again, with new malware payloads, improved delivery, and increased defense evasion.\n",
            "  Overview\n",
            "The social engineering attacks are still initiated in a similar manner. Users within the target environment will be email bombed by the threat actor, which is often achieved by signing up the user’s email to numerous mailing lists simultaneously. After the email bomb, the threat actor will reach out to the impacted users. Rapid7 has observed the initial contact still occurs primarily through usage of Microsoft Teams, by which the threat actor, as an external user, will attempt to call or message the impacted user to offer assistance. The account domains in use include both Azure/Entra tenant subdomains (e.g., username[@]tenantsubdomain[.]onmicrosoft[.]com) and custom domains (e.g., username[@]cofincafe[.]com).\n",
            "In many cases, Rapid7 has observed that the threat actor will pretend to be a member of the target organization’s help desk, support team, or otherwise present themself as IT staff. Below are examples of Microsoft Teams display names observed, by Rapid7, to be in use by operators. The display names may or may not be padded with whitespace characters. Rapid7 has also observed threat actors use a first and last name, as the chat display name and/or account username, to impersonate an IT staff member within the targeted organization.\n",
            "Operator Chat Display Name\n",
            "Help Desk\n",
            "HELP DESK\n",
            "Help Desk Manager\n",
            "Technical Support\n",
            "Administracion\n",
            "If the user interacts with the lure, either by answering the call or messaging back, the threat actor will attempt to get the user to install or execute a remote management (RMM) tool, including, but not limited to, QuickAssist, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Level, or ScreenConnect. Rapid7 has also observed attempts to leverage the OpenSSH client, a native Windows utility, to establish a reverse shell. In at least one instance, the threat actor shared a QR code with the targeted user. The purpose of the QR code is unconfirmed but appears to be an attempt to bypass MFA after stealing a user’s credentials. The URL embedded within the QR code adheres to the following format: hxxps://&lt;company_name&gt;[.]qr-&lt;letter&gt;&lt;number&gt;[.]com.\n",
            " Figure 1. A QR code (obfuscation by Rapid7) sent by an operator.  In a majority of cases, Rapid7 has observed that the operator, after gaining access to the user’s asset via RMM tool, will then attempt to download and execute additional malware payloads. In one case handled by Rapid7, the operator requested more time — potentially to hand off the access to another member of the group.  Figure 2. An operator stalls for time.  The payload delivery methods vary per case, but have included external compromised SharePoint instances, common file sharing websites, servers rented through hosting providers, or even direct upload to the compromised asset in the case of RMM tool remote control. In one case, the operator used the group’s custom credential harvester to dump the user’s credentials, the results for which were subsequently uploaded to a file sharing site — publicly exposing the stolen credentials. SharePoint has been used to distribute copies of AnyDesk portable, likely to circumvent security measures that would prevent the user from downloading it directly from anydesk[.]com. Such attempts have been blocked by web proxy in previous cases.\n",
            "The overall goal following initial access appears to be the same: to quickly enumerate the environment and dump the user’s credentials. When possible, operators will also still attempt to steal any available VPN configuration files. With the user’s credentials, organization VPN information, and potential MFA bypass, it may be possible for them to authenticate directly to the target environment.\n",
            "Rapid7 has observed usage of the same credential harvesting executable, previously reported as AntiSpam.exe, though it is now delivered in the form of a DLL and most commonly executed via rundll32.exe. Whereas before it was an unobfuscated .NET executable, the program is now commonly contained within a compiled 64-bit DLL loader. Rapid7 has analyzed at least one sample that has also been obfuscated using the group’s custom packer. The newest versions of the credential harvester now save output to the file 123.txt in the user’s %TEMP% directory, an update from the previous qwertyuio.txt file, though versions of the DLL distributed earlier in the campaign would still output to the previous file.\n",
            " Figure 3. The credential harvesting prompt shown to the user upon executing the DLL (redaction by Rapid7).  The credential harvester is most commonly followed by the execution of a loader such as Zbot (a.k.a. Zloader) or DarkGate. This can then serve as a gateway to the execution of subsequent payloads in memory, facilitate data theft, or otherwise perform malicious actions. Rapid7 has also observed operators distributing alternate payload archives containing Cobalt Strike beacon loaders and a pair of Java payloads containing a user credential harvester variant and a custom multi-threaded beacon by which to remotely execute PowerShell commands. In some cases, operators have sent the user a short command, via Teams, which will then begin an infection chain after execution by the targeted user.\n",
            "Rapid7 continues to observe inconsistent usage of the group’s custom packer to deliver various malware payloads, including their custom credential harvester. A YARA rule is now publicly available that can be used to detect the packer. For example, this packer was used to deliver several obfuscated versions of Black Basta ransomware, obtained via open source intelligence, which directly links operators to the ongoing social engineering campaign.\n",
            "At the time of writing, the threat actors behind the campaign continue to update both their strategy for gaining initial access and the tools subsequently used. For example, around the time the most recent campaign activity began, Rapid7 observed the delivery of a timestamped and versioned payload archive, 171024_V1US.zip (2024-10-17, version 1, US), which, when compared to a more recently delivered archive, 171124_V15.zip (2024-11-17, version 15), highlights the rapid iteration being undertaken. Many of the payloads being delivered follow a similar pattern as previous activity and often consist of a legitimate file where an export or function entry point has been overwritten to jump to malicious code, and the result is signed with a likely stolen code signing certificate.\n",
            "Intrusions related to the campaign should be taken seriously — the intent goes beyond typical phishing activity. Past campaign activity has led to the deployment of Black Basta ransomware. While Rapid7 has handled a high volume of incidents related to the current social engineering campaign across a variety of customer environments, to date, every case has been contained before the operator was able to move laterally beyond the targeted user’s asset.\n",
            "Technical Analysis Initial Access Each attack is preceded by the targeted user receiving an often overwhelming amount of emails. An operator will then attempt to contact the user via Microsoft Teams, either via messaging or calling, by which they will pretend to offer assistance. Operators will attempt to impersonate the organization’s help desk, such as using the names of existing staff members.\n",
            "During this social engineering stage, operators often need to troubleshoot with the user to establish remote control of the user’s asset. Based on the environment, for example, RMM tool downloads or execution may be blocked (often some, but not all) or QuickAssist may be disabled, causing the operator to cycle through their options at establishing a foothold. One of the most common first steps after gaining either the confidence of the user, or remote access, is to execute a custom credential harvester.\n",
            "Credential Harvesting The credential harvester used by operators, for example SafeStore.dll (SHA256: 3B7E06F1CCAA207DC331AFD6F91E284FEC4B826C3C427DFFD0432FDC48D55176), is an updated version of the previously analyzed program AntiSpam.exe. The DLL variant of the credential harvester is executed by a command like the following example:\n",
            " rundll32.exe SafeStore.dll,epaas_request_clone \n",
            "The module will quickly execute three enumeration commands to gather system information — systeminfo, route print, ipconfig /all — and then prompt the user for their password. The user’s credentials are appended onto a new line of the text file 123.txt with each attempt, after the enumeration command output, regardless of whether the credentials are correct. If the user enters the wrong pass\n",
