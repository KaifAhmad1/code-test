            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.   Nearly all files are digitally signed by of “Foshan Yongqiheng Trading Co., Ltd.” The metadata for each file—including copyright, product, description, internal name, and comments—reflects the name under which it was downloaded. Notably, the signing date aligns with the download date.    Other samples are signed by “Langfang Alkem Material Technology Co., Ltd.”, including those with the following hashes:   42c1550b035353ae529e98304f89bf6065647833e582d08f0228185b493d0022 8d911ef72bdb4ec5b99b7548c0c89ffc8639068834a5e2b684c9d78504550927 92d2488e401d24a4bfc1598d813bc53af5c225769efedf0c7e5e4083623f4486 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 aa25a7c2520da54ba2045a21de252632c93f8eae06e031091ab908dca4eadf45    The only file lacking a digital signature in the list shown above is 941fa9119eb1413fdd4f05333e285c49935280cc85f167fb31627012ef71a6b3 Regarding the tayakay[.]com domain, when a user visits the site that is embedded with tayakay[.]com JS script, it constructs a query parameter containing victim information – such as device name, IP address and others – to send to the js.php endpoint.   By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

Multiple third-party reports describe similar activity. Orange Cyberdefense encountered campaigns in France in May and June 2024. In September, GitHub-themed phishing messages reportedly directed victims to a site that used the fake verification to deploy the LummaC2 infostealer.\n",
            "In 2023, CTU researchers warned about the growing threat from infostealers. Threat actors regularly use infostealers to obtain credentials for a wide range of online services and corporate networks. The criminals then sell this access in  underground marketplaces or use the access to conduct attacks such as phishing hotel customers. CTU analysis of underground activity related to the September 2024 incident response engagements revealed that credentials collected from victims of the fake human verification prompt were published to Russian Market within days of collection.\n",
            "CTU researchers recommend that organizations implement policies restricting employees from using corporate systems to browse for streaming services or risky content. Organizations should also conduct regular social engineering training that incorporates up-to-date threat intelligence on the latest techniques. Using web proxies to limit access to potentially malicious web pages could mitigate this threat.\n",

            "Text: October 11, 2024   Overview This week, the SonicWall Capture Labs threat research team investigated a sample of CoreWarrior malware. This is a persistent trojan that attempts to spread rapidly by creating dozens of copies of itself and reaching out to multiple IP addresses, opening multiple sockets for backdoor access, and hooking Windows UI elements for monitoring. Infection Cycle The malware is a UPX-packed executable that has been manually tampered with and will not unpack using the standard UPX unpacker.          Figures 1 (top), 2(bottom): Initial detection, and failure due to checksum error  On runtime, the executable creates a copy of itself with a randomly generated name. The copy will launch a command prompt and use curl to POST data to “http://wecan.hasthe(dot)technology/upload”. With each subsequent POST that is completed, the parent program will delete the existing copy and create a new copy. During testing, one hundred and seventeen copies were created and deleted in under ten minutes.      Figure 3: Malware is connecting to site and posting data  As messages are being sent, the program will then bind a listener on ports 49730-49777 and 50334-50679. A secondary IP address of 172.67.183.40 had a single connection made, but no TCP/UDP traffic was sent.      Figure 4: Multi-part output of data sent  The parent process will obtain information on the system drives, as well as create a hook for the command prompt window to monitor for changes. The malware has several types of anti-analysis capabilities, including:  Anti-debug using rdtsc to check debug times; program will exit if times exceed threshold Evasion using a randomized sleep timer that changes per number of connection attempts/successes/failures (Figure 4) VM environment detection, as there are strings to check for HyperV containers       Figure 5: Variables used in sleep determinations  Other protocols referenced by the code include FTP, SMTP, and POP3 for data exfiltration. SonicWall Protections To ensure SonicWall customers are prepared for any exploitation that may occur due to this malware, the following signatures have been released:  CoreWarrior.A  IOCs 85A6E921E4D5107D13C1EB8647B130A1D54BA2B6409118BE7945FD71C6C8235F (packed) 8C97329CF7E48BB1464AC5132B6A02488B5F0358752B71E3135D9D0E4501B48D (unpacked)      The SonicWall Capture Labs Threat Research Team gathers, analyzes and vets cross-vector threat information from the SonicWall Capture Threat network, consisting of global devices and resources, including more than 1 million security sensors in nearly 200 countries and territories.

We attribute their success primarily to their unusual distribution methods.\\n*   Successful data theft by infostealers can lead to severe consequences for organizations, including financial loss, intellectual property theft, and compromised sensitive data. This stolen data can also serve as initial access for further attacks.\\n*   To combat the use of infostealers, the ReliaQuest Threat Research team recommends implementing security enhancements such as certificate-based authentication for enhanced user access security, utilizing enterprise browsers with advanced security features, and establishing a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to monitor for exposed credentials.\\n\\nInfostealer malware, which covertly infiltrates systems and harvests sensitive information, poses a significant risk to individual and organizational security. Infostealers have been a persistent threat for many years, with the earliest variant, ZeuS, emerging in 2006. Since this early example, infostealers have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Cybercriminal activity involving infostealers spiked significantly from Q3 to Q4 2023: ReliaQuest noted a 30.5% increase in cybercriminal forums marketplace listings for \\u201cstealer logs\\u201d (data harvested by infostealer malware).\\n\\nThis report provides an overview of common infostealer variants; describes their targeted geographies and sectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and outlines general mitigation steps and best practices.\\n\\nInfostealers Overview\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ever-increasing complexity and prevalence of infostealer malware is fueled by the lucrative nature of stolen data, which is commonly sold on cybercriminal forums, marketplaces, and messaging applications like Telegram. Once adversaries extract valuable information, they sometimes share stealer logs for free on these platforms; subsequent resharing on other forums allows even more threat actors to access the data at no cost.\\n\\nInfostealers are designed to infiltrate computers and transmit sensitive data, including:\\n\\n*   Usernames and passwords\\n*   Cookies\\n*   Credit card data\\n*   Cryptocurrency wallets\\n*   Browser history\\n*   Hardware/software information\\n\\nThis malware typically targets credentials from online banking websites, social media platforms, email accounts, and file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts. Modern infostealers often function as part of botnets, enabling attackers to remotely connect to an infected host and transmit data via command-and-control (C2) servers. These malicious entities spread infostealers through methods like spam email attachments, compromised websites, and malware advertising, often in conjunction with other malware types such as downloaders, Trojan droppers, and keyloggers.\\n\\nStealer malware can pose big risks with profound impacts, illustrating the critical need for heightened awareness and sophisticated defense strategies. For example, the now-notorious Change Healthcare cyber attack was initiated through compromised credentials that can be sourced from infostealer malware.\\n\\nInfostealers can disproportionately affect different sectors, geographies, and technologies. Sectors handling significant sensitive information like healthcare, finance, and retail are particularly at risk. Geographically, regions that are commonly targeted for ransomware, such as the US, UK, and Canada, seem to be most at risk. The reason behind the geographical targets is highly likely due to the higher demand in compromised credentials being purchased for these regions.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a more specific look at how threat actors can maliciously leverage stolen information:\\n\\n*   **Initial access for further attacks**: Once threat actors obtain initial access through stolen data, they can use this foothold to extract more sensitive information or to introduce other malicious software, such as ransomware, into the system.\\n*   **Credential stuffing attacks**: Threat actors may use stolen credentials to perform credential stuffing attacks on corporate accounts, exploiting the common issue of password reuse across multiple platforms.\\n*   **Bank account access**: Threat actors might attempt to access bank accounts using the stolen credentials and drain the funds or use the accounts for money laundering purposes.\\n\\nWhile infostealer malware has historically targeted individuals, the threat to corporate organizations is significant and growing. The ramifications of an infostealer malware infection for organizations are profound, encompassing not only financial loss and intellectual property theft but also severe data breaches that could impact the entire organizational structure. This malware type not only facilitates financial exploitation but also serves as a gateway for further attacks, potentially leading to widespread ransomware infections.\\n\\nMost Common Infostealers in 2023\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team has compiled an overview of the most common infostealers we observed in 2023: LummaC2, RedLine, and Raccoon.\\n\\n#### LummaC2\\n\\nLummaC2 was most prevalent infostealer in 2023, according to ReliaQuest\\u2019s collection of dark web marketplace listings. In addition, the number of LummaC2-obtained logs listed for sale increased by 110% from Q3 to Q4 2023. LummaC2\\u2019s rising popularity among adversaries is likely due to its high success rate, which refers to its effectiveness in successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data without detection. Additionally, its intuitive user interface (UI) makes the tool accessible to threat actors across a wide spectrum of skill levels.\\n\\nThe pricing model for a LummaC2 subscription ranges from $250 to $1,000 per month, depending on the subscription tier selected.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 1: LummaC2 subscription service and description_\\n\\nLummaC2 is best known for using unconventional distribution tactics, including the deployment of trojanized software files and spearphishing emails equipped with deceptive links or attachments. This method allows LummaC2 to bypass some standard security measures designed to catch more common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads.\\n\\nFurthermore, LummaC2 targets a comprehensive array of sensitive data not limited to traditional credentials. It focuses on cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and two-factor authentication (2FA) details. This targeted approach makes LummaC2 particularly perilous for businesses that manage digital assets or utilize extensive online financial services.\\n\\nLummaC2 sets itself apart in the landscape of infostealers through its broad targeting capabilities and systematic extraction methods. Capable of infiltrating a range of systems from Windows 7 to Windows 11 and compatible with at least ten different web browsers, LummaC2\\u2019s adaptability is unmatched. Its ability to target and exfiltrate data from applications related to cryptocurrency and extensions further distinguishes it as a significant threat, especially given the rising prominence of digital currencies in business operations.\\n\\nThe stealthy nature of LummaC2\\u2019s operations makes it particularly dangerous, as it can siphon sensitive information without immediate detection, multiplying the potential damage.\\n\\n#### Redline\\n\\nRedLine ranked as the second most prevalent infostealer ReliaQuest identified in 2023, with a 44% rise in listings from Q3 to Q4 2023. This growth is noteworthy, yet it falls far short of LummaC2\\u2019s growth rate. The popularity of RedLine can likely be attributed to its high success rate of exfiltrating financial data such as cryptocurrency wallets. While not as prolific as LummaC2, RedLine has made a name for itself in the cybercriminal world due to its high infection rate and more affordable malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription starting at $100 per month, as compared to competitors, most of which start at $250.\\n\\nSince its inception in March 2020, RedLine has been utilized by initial access brokers and other malicious actors on Russian-language cybercriminal forums. It specializes in exfiltrating passwords, credit card details, instant messages, and cryptocurrency wallet information. Over time, RedLine\\u2019s distribution methods have evolved from phishing emails themed around COVID-19 to using adware through malicious Google ads, weaponizing Microsoft Office documents, and targeting digital artists in the NFT space. More recently, it has adapted by masquerading as a Windows 11 upgrade tool, demonstrating its ability to exploit current trends to enhance its dissemination.\\n\\nRedLine\\u2019s extensive technical capabilities enable it to perform a variety of malicious activities that are particularly disruptive to organizations. RedLine allows adversaries to harvest system information such as browser types, FTP client details, and hardware configurations. It can perform a range of malicious activities, including uploading and downloading files, executing commands, and relaying information about compromised systems back to the attackers. Such functionalities not only allow for the theft of sensitive data but also potentially facilitate deeper network penetration and lateral movement within a corporate environment, leading to more extensive breaches and data compromise.\\n\\nRedLine differentiates itself from other prominent infostealers like LummaC2 and Raccoon through its targeting strategy and distribution techniques. RedLine has a broader target spectrum and uses more varied distribution methods. Compared to Raccoon, which also operates on a MaaS model, RedLine\\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to current trends and its lower entry price point make it accessible and dangerous.\\n\\n#### Raccoon\\n\\nReliaQuest identified Raccoon Stealer, sometimes rendered as \\u201cRacoon,\\u201d as the third most common information stealer in 2023. Despite its ranking, mentions of Raccoon on the dark web saw a drastic decrease from Q3 to Q4 2023, largely due to the arrest of Mark Sokolovsky, a pivotal figure behind Raccoon, in late 2022. This arrest disrupted operations temporarily and led to significant law enforcement scrutiny, which temporarily halted Raccoon\\u2019s activities.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is adept at stealing a wide range of data from over 60 different applications, including sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, browsing history, and cryptocurrency wallet data. In August 2023, the developers released an updated version based on user feedback and market trends. This version introduced features like an innovative URL search method for quick data access, automatic bot detection and blocking, and detailed log statistics.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer\\u2019s subscription was initially priced at $200 per month but increased to $275 in August 2023. It is also offered at $125 per week, making it accessible for short-term use.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is differentiated by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, catering to less technically skilled cybercriminals. Raccoon focuses on providing a simple yet effective tool for extensive data harvesting, making it particularly dangerous for organizations. The stealer\\u2019s ability to target a vast range of applications and its enhancements aimed at evading detection make it a formidable tool for extracting corporate data.\\n\\nThe resilience and adaptability of Raccoon Stealer, despite significant disruptions such as the arrest of its key developer, highlight the persistent threat posed by such cybercriminal tools. Organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts to defend against such sophisticated malware.\\n\\n#### LummaC2 Case Study\\n\\nIn October 2023, ReliaQuest observed in a customer environment the execution of the unauthorized file \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar,\\u201d which is associated with LummaC2. Shortly before the malicious file was downloaded, the user attempted to install a cracked license key from the license key download service \\u201chdlicense\\\\[.\\\\]com.\\u201d This redirected the user to \\u201chxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S,\\u201d where the user was prompted to download the malicious RAR file. After clicking the download prompt, the user was redirected to multiple domains, including \\u201csustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\u201d and a free file-hosting server that initiated the LummaC2 malware download.\\n\\n\\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d contained multiple files, including a legitimate, signed copy of the cross-platform media player \\u201cVLC Player\\u201d renamed as \\u201cSetup.exe\\u201d and the LummaC2 executable. The executable used a technique called Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading to import a copy of the VLC Player library (\\u201clibvlc.dll\\u201d), which then imported a malicious version of the library (\\u201clibvlccore.dll\\u201d). libvlccore.dll loaded the LummaC2 payload. Using DLL side-loading enabled the adversary to bypass security measures, execute the malware, and establish a C2 connection to \\u201chxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 2](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers1.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 2: Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar file contents_\\n\\nIn this case study, ReliaQuest communicated to the impacted organization our recommendation to first isolate the impacted endpoint to disable any communication or active connections. We then deleted the \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d file and blocked all associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). The impacted organization rotated the user\\u2019s credentials, reimaged the endpoint, and notified the user of the organization\\u2019s acceptable use policy (AUP). Further communication with the impacted customer confirmed that no additional IOCs or C2 traffic were identified following these steps.\\n\\nThis incident showcases characteristic hallmarks of LummaC2, including the use of legitimate software to disguise malware activities and the exploitation of less secure third-party download sites. To prevent similar incidents, organizations should implement stringent controls on software downloads and installations, which in this case allowed the initial download of a cracked software key.\\n\\nBelow is a list of IoCs we observed in this case study:\\n\\n| **IOC** | **Type** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 7a35008a1a1ae3d093703c3a34a21993409af42eb61161aad1b6ae4afa8bbb70 | Hash |\\n| a9e9d7770ff948bb65c0db24431f75dd934a803181afa22b6b014fac9a162dab | Hash |\\n| hxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api | URL |\\n| hxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S | URL |\\n| hxxps://download2361.mediafire\\\\[.\\\\]com/kz5hd3dkenwgED02vBaT\\\\_kwGFdmwQ1 iAY4QGf3SAcLidcmbEn-K1HrKyPpR6ADOq7VjezmdEoNhZJFB\\\\_Wze08J1MU0iH\\\\_ oPWGS6Myj12LuXef9l7y\\\\_Em63yxedx88ezRHTt44POY858wKHjwxqr2errwIun SIHwCNMWQNQPY4\\\\_0FkZKD/wt0hho282tuxy9d/Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar | URL |\\n| sustac\\\\[.\\\\]com | Domain |\\n\\nThreat Forecast\\n---------------\\n\\nWe predict that in 2024, LummaC2 and RedLine activity will continue to grow. With the sales of credentials obtained via LummaC2 more than doubling from Q3 to Q4 2023, the stealer shows no signs of slowing down. RedLine, with its 44% rise in dark web marketplace presence in the same period and a diverse range of associated tactics for distribution and data theft, is highly probable to continue to grow. Its adaptability and affordability make it an attractive option for cybercriminals looking to harvest sensitive information efficiently.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the usage of Raccoon will likely continue to decline throughout 2024. The drastic decrease in mentions and sales of Raccoon stealer logs on cybercriminal forums toward the end of 2023 suggests threat actors\\u2019 waning interest in this tool. This downturn may result from its outdated evasion tactics, the emergence of more advanced stealers like LummaC2 and RedLine, and the arrest of a key figure behind Raccoon in late 2022. This arrest not only disrupted Raccoon\\u2019s operations but also exposed the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure, likely diminishing its appeal to cybercriminals.\\n\\nMitigations, Recommendations, and Best Practices\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile ReliaQuest Digital Risk Protection can alert customers when credentials appear in breaches or are sold on sites like Russian Market, we also take a more proactive approach. To identify the use of stealer malware, ReliaQuest offers detection rules. Implementing these rules will allow defenders to identify unauthorized software that violates policy obligations. These rules can be calibrated to each organization\\u2019s environment, to attain a higher level of fidelity and reduce false positives. In addition, we also provide containment and response plays for each detection rule. These automated plays can be executed by customers to mitigate threats if they are enabled.\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team offers the following inexhaustive list of recommendations and best practices to protect against infostealers\\u2019 impact.\\n\\n*   **Prevent saving of passwords in browsers**: Implement strict network policies or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable the saving of passwords in web browsers. This security measure is crucial as many infostealers target saved credentials in browsers to exfiltrate sensitive information. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance and effectiveness.\\n*   **Shorter session cookie timeouts**: Configure shorter session cookie timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking. By limiting the duration of sessions, even if an attacker gains access to session cookies, their window of opportunity is significantly reduced. This enhances overall security by forcing users to re-authenticate more frequently.\\n*   **Cert based authentication**: Adopt certificate-based authentication to strengthen the security of user access. Certificates provide a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords and are less susceptible to phishing attacks. Implementing this method can significantly improve the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive systems.\\n*   **Enterprise browsers**: Utilize enterprise browsers that offer enhanced security features tailored for organizational needs. These browsers often provide better management and security controls, including the ability to enforce policies, monitor usage, and protect against malicious websites. Integrating enterprise browsers can bolster security while maintaining user productivity.\\n*   **DRP for monitoring for exposed credentials**: Establish a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to continuously monitor for exposed credentials. DRP solutions can scan the dark web, paste sites, and other sources to detect if any corporate credentials have been compromised. Rapid detection allows for swift remediation actions, such as password resets and user notifications, to mitigate potential damage.\\n*   **Employee training and awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with infostealers. Training should cover the identification of phishing emails, suspicious links, and unusual requests that may be attempts to install malware. An informed workforce is a critical defense against social engineering attacks.\"}]\n"
