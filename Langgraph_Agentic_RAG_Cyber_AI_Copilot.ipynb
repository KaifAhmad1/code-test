            "Text: On October 20, a hacker who calls themselves Dark X said they logged in to a server and stole the personal data of 350 million Hot Topic customers. The following day, Dark X listed the data, including alleged emails, addresses, phone numbers, and partial credit card numbers, for sale on an underground forum. The day after that, Dark X said Hot Topic kicked them out. Dark X told me that the apparent breach, which is possibly the largest hack of a consumer retailer ever, was partly due to luck. They just happened to get login credentials from a developer who had access to Hot Topic’s crown jewels. To prove it, Dark X sent me the developer’s login credentials for Snowflake, a data warehousing tool that hackers have repeatedly targeted recently. Alon Gal from cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock, which first found the link between infostealers and the Hot Topic breach, said he was sent the same set of credentials by the hacker. The luck part is true. But the claimed Hot Topic hack is also the latest breach directly connected to a sprawling underground industry that has made hacking some of the most important companies in the world child’s play.  AT&amp;T. Ticketmaster. Santander Bank. Neiman Marcus. Electronic Arts. These were not entirely isolated incidents. Instead, they were all hacked thanks to “infostealers,” a type of malware that is designed to pillage passwords and cookies stored in the victim’s browser. In turn, infostealers have given birth to a complex ecosystem that has been allowed to grow in the shadows and where criminals fulfill different roles. There are Russian malware coders continually updating their code; teams of professionals who use glitzy advertising to hire contractors to spread the malware across YouTube, TikTok, or GitHub; and English-speaking teenagers on the other side of the world who then use the harvested credentials to break into corporations. At the end of October, a collaboration of law enforcement agencies announced an operation against two of the world’s most prevalent stealers. But the market has been able to grow and mature so much that now law enforcement action against even one part of it is unlikely to make any lasting dent in the spread of infostealers. Based on interviews with malware developers, hackers who use the stolen credentials, and a review of manuals that tell new recruits how to spread the malware, 404 Media has mapped out this industry. Its end result is that a download of an innocent-looking piece of software by a single person can lead to a data breach at a multibillion-dollar company, putting Google and other tech giants in an ever-escalating cat-and-mouse game with the malware developers to keep people and companies safe. “We are professionals in our field and will continue to work on bypassing future Google updates,” an administrator for LummaC2, one of the most popular pieces of infostealer malware, told me in an online chat. “It takes some time, but we have all the resources and knowledge to continue the fight against Chrome.” The Stealers The infostealer ecosystem starts with the malware itself. Dozens of these exist, with names like Nexus, Aurora, META, and Raccoon. The most widespread infostealer at the moment is one called RedLine, according to cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Having a prepackaged piece of malware also dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for a budding new hacker. The administrator of LummaC2, which Recorded Future says is in the top 10 of infostealers, said it welcomes both beginner and experienced hackers. Initially, many of these developers were interested in stealing credentials or keys related to cryptocurrency wallets. Armed with those, hackers could empty a victim’s digital wallets and make a quick buck. Many today still market their tools as being able to steal bitcoin and have even introduced OCR to detect seed phrases in images. But recently those same developers and their associates figured out that all of the other stuff stored in a browser—passwords to the victim’s place of work, for example—could generate a secondary stream of revenue.   “Malware developers and their clients have realized that personal and corporate credentials, such as login details for online accounts, financial data, and other sensitive information, hold substantial value on the black market,” RussianPanda, an independent security researcher who follows infostealers closely, told 404 Media. Infostealer creators pivoted to capture this information too, she said. In essence, the exhaust from cryptocurrency-focused heists has created an entire new industry in its own right that is causing even more destruction across healthcare, tech, and other industries. Some stealers then sell these collected credentials and cookies, or logs, themselves via bots on Telegram. Telegram, rather than acting as simply a messaging app, provides critical infrastructure for these teams. The entire process from buying to selling stolen logs is automated through Telegram bots. Telegram did not respond to a request for comment. Infostealers are not especially hard to write, but the malware developers constantly butt heads with engineers inside tech giants, such as Google, who are trying to stop them from stealing users’ credentials. In July, for example, Google Chrome rolled out an update that was designed to lock applications other than Chrome—including malware—from accessing cookie data. For a moment, Chrome had the upper hand. LummaC2 gave its users some workarounds, but none were a reliable fix. Some malware developers make their grievances known more explicitly. In one update, a pair of infostealers included the phrase “ChromeFuckNewCookies” in their malware’s code. “It's a little bit of a cat and mouse, but we think that this is a game that we want to play as much as we can if the outcomes remain positive,” Will Harris, staff software engineer on Google Chrome, said. “We want to protect users, obviously, as much as we can.” That doesn’t just come in securing Chrome itself and protecting more data from infostealers. It also includes “disruption,” such as more researchers writing about infostealers’ particular techniques, which in turn constrains the tools available to the malware developers. Releasing updates one by one on a regular basis, rather than all at once, can also disrupt the malware developers. Instead of the criminal coders knowing what they need to fix all in one go, they can never be quite sure what Google is going to clamp down on next, wasting more of their time.   After one update, a lot of the customers of a stealer were “extremely upset, and they [the malware makers] had to work nights on coming up with a bypass,” Harris said. He added that one stealer, called Vidar, increased the cost of its tool too. “We have to stay agile here. I mean the infostealers are moving fast on this as well, and we want to be keeping up with them, and I think we are able to in this case,” he said. He also pointed specifically to Microsoft Windows. “When you compare Windows with, say, Android, or with ChromeOS, or even macOS, those platforms have this strong application isolation.” Meaning, that malware has a harder time stealing data from other parts of the system. “We noticed on Windows, which was obviously a major platform for us, that these protections didn’t exist.” In an email, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “In addition to the hardware-backed baseline requirements for all Windows PCs—such as, TPM, Secure Boot, and virtualization-based security, there are many security features now enabled by default in Win11 which makes it more difficult for info-stealers. Our guidance is that users should run as Standard User and not Admin on their Windows device. Running standard user means users (and apps being used by users) can make changes to their computer but do not have full system access by default, so that info stealers will not have the full access required to make it easy to steal the data that they are after.” Infostealer malware for Mac does exist, but to a much smaller degree, according to Recorded Future. A malware creator may have an effective piece of software in their hands. But ultimately getting that software onto victims’ computers is the job of someone else.

The camera pans around their alleged apartment: huge floor-to-ceiling windows in a large dining room, wood-paneled floors, and a funky chandelier.
