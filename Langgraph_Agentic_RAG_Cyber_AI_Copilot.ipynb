            "Text: Forescout’s Security Operations Center (SOC) recently investigated a malware incident on a customer’s network involving malware disguised as Google Chrome. During the investigation, we discovered the domain hosting the malware had been involved in similar attacks using fake Microsoft Teams and fake Microsoft Edge installers prompting a deeper look into the incidents. As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems. The threat actor may have dual objectives:  Immediate monetization through the sale of harvested data and access Preparation for larger-scale cyberattacks (either to directly exploit high-value targets or sell access)  We are tracking this as a distinct cluster referred to as Chaya_002. The name ‘Chaya’ follows our naming convention for unknown threat clusters (it means ‘shadow’ in Sanskrit). By tracking this threat as Chaya_002, we can focus on its unique attributes and ongoing evolution. We are closely watching for new tactics or tools used by the threat actors to distinguish it from previously known malware clusters. For example, we have already identified changes in the threat actor’s delivery mechanisms — specifically in the malware’s file characteristics and storage.  Malware Activity Cluster: ‘Chaya_002’ Details and Characteristics   Unique Payload Characteristics  Chaya_002 has distinct payload and post-infection tactics worth investigating. The delivery, download and staging mechanisms resemble:   Scarlet Goldfinch   FakeSG   ClearFake   FakeUpdateRU   SocGholish   Evolving Functionality As of September 23, the malware exhibited new behaviors, including:  Executes PowerShell commands from within MSIX bundles Uses AutoIt scripts Uses WMIC to gather domain information  Distinct Tool Usage Unlike previous versions, this malware can download additional tools other than NetSupport RMM which showcases developing capabilities. Progression in File Naming Conventions Previously, files were named with patterns like: Update_[date_components].js, Update_[random_numeric_string].[msix|exe] or [legitimate_software_name]_[random_numeric_string].exe. Now, we observe a shift to names like upd_[random_numeric_string].[exe|msix] Transition in File Types The malware payload has shifted from JavaScript files (.js) to executable formats (.msix, .exe) showing ongoing refinement in deployment and increasing its potential impact. Diversification of File Path The threat actor rotates through various WordPress directory structures to store malware:  wp-includes/[css|promo|uploads] wp-admin/images wp-includes/images/ wp-content/upgrades  Similar Malware Incidents Trigger Our Investigation On September 20, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security issued a TLP:AMBER cyber flash, “CF24-005 – Tactics, techniques and procedures associated with malware masquerading as an MS Teams installer”, in response to an incident that occurred on September 9. The attack leveraged users’ tendency to search for Microsoft Teams via their Windows Start Menu. Instead of reaching the official Microsoft page, the user landed on an SEO poisoned page that prompted them to download what appeared to be MS Teams installer. Upon further investigation, the Cyber Centre discovered several TTPs associated with this attack, including password dumping, Kerberoasting, persistence through run keys, collection of user-specific information, and exfiltration via C2 Beacon.  The Cyber Centre’s investigation noted that the domain responsible for distributing this fake Teams installer was apple-online[.]shop. A day earlier, on September 19, Forescout Security Operations Center (SOC) had blocked an access attempt to a suspicious domain, hxxps://tayakay[.]com/analytics.js. This domain was injecting a malicious JavaScript file into legitimate websites, in this case www[.]powerlineblog[.]com. The script then redirected users to a /js.php endpoint on the same domain, which initiated the download of a malicious file, upd_6259478.exe, from a compromised WordPress site (hxxps://airbluefootgear[.]com/wp-includes/images/xits.php).   The upd_6259478.exe executable runs the PowerShell command shown below, which downloads and runs another file, named ChromeSetup.exe, from a temporary folder. The source of this download was apple-online[.]shop – the same domain seen in the Canadian incident – which resolved to two IP addresses: 172.67.178[.]253 and 104.21.67[.]172.   Upon execution, upd_6259478.exe initiates network communication with the remote IP 217.148.142[.]19, a recurring element in this malware cluster. Multiple samples have been observed connecting to this IP, which was previously identified nearly three years ago as a Cobalt Strike command and control (C2) server. In earlier versions of similar malware samples, we also observed the use of a PowerShell command to establish persistence by creating a .lnk file in the Windows Startup folder. This .lnk file pointed to the upd_* executable, ensuring it ran automatically at system startup. Additionally, all samples were observed querying system information about the infected machine, likely for reconnaissance purposes.   Most of the other TTPs observed in this customer incident were consistent with those identified by the Canadian Cyber Centre, with the exception of Kerberoasting. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the executable was likely run in a sandbox environment that wasn’t domain-joined, which may have prevented Kerberoasting from being triggered. However, there was no explicit event to verify this.   Uncovering Further Malicious Activity in Fake Google Chrome and Fake MS ‘Setup’ Executables Since both incidents originated from apple-online[.]shop, we pivoted off this domain to investigate the activity cluster behind them. One notable observation was the submission of the URL apple-online[.]shop/MicrosoftEdgeSetup.exe (file hash: 7531341da720162541747b3142722f9c52d9d5fe57678d8aeefa62532014f672) to VirusTotal. This file, with a creation time of 2024-07-24 17:53:31 UTC carries a legitimate Microsoft signature. We hypothesize that the threat actors might be testing the file delivery mechanism.   Further VirusTotal analysis revealed several additional files uploaded between September 10 and September 21, 2024, all directly linked to this domain.

By constructing a query in URLScan based on the observed characteristics, we identified additional pivot points exhibiting similar behavior. This investigation revealed an additional extension, “/adcount.js”, along with a mechanism that redirects users based on the returned content. According to URLScan results, approximately 87 domains currently have analytics.js embedded in their sites.   From previous samples, it is likely that these sites are using a Traffic Distribution System (TDS) which redirects users to another page—often another compromised WordPress site—that delivers fake executables embedded with malicious code. By analyzing the file naming patterns, we uncovered several compromised WordPress pages, as well as second stage malware that was downloaded via PowerShell.   The threat actor employs multi-vector approach, with objectives of network infiltration and data acquisition. The end goal appears to be facilitating large-scale cyberattacks where feasible, through one or more of three phases:   Initial Reconnaissance: Harvesting user-specif\n",

As a result, we identified several new malware samples, domains and IP addresses, including Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP), threat-hunting opportunities and detection strategies. The Indicators of Compromise (IoC) are also available on Forescout Vedere Labs’ threat feed. The malware’s primary purpose is reconnaissance to gather user and network information for detailed profiles of potential targets. This information could serve as a foundation for more targeted future attacks ranging from deploying customized ransomware to installing remote access tools on individual systems.']\n",

            "We recently discovered a novel version of the RomCom malware family called SnipBot and, for the first time, show post-infection activity from the attacker on a victim system. This new strain makes use of new tricks and unique code obfuscation methods in addition to those seen in previous versions of RomCom 3.0 and PEAPOD (RomCom 4.0).\n",
            "In early April, our sandbox Advanced WildFire discovered an unusual DLL module that turned out to be part of a broader tool set called SnipBot. By examining the malware sample and using Cortex XDR telemetry data, we were able to reconstruct the infection chain and the attacker's subsequent actions.\n",
            "We also discovered more related malware strains dating back to December 2023. Although the aim of the attacker is unknown, the behavior we observed indicates an attempt to pivot through the victim's network and exfiltrate certain files.\n",
            "SnipBot gives the attacker the ability to execute commands and download additional modules onto a victim's system. It is a new version of the RomCom malware that is mainly based on RomCom 3.0. However, it also contains techniques seen in its offshoot PEAPOD called RomCom 4.0 by Trend Micro. Therefore, we’ve assigned it version 5.0.\n",
            "This threat operates in several stages, with the initial downloader always being an executable, followed by further EXEs or DLLs. The downloader we observed was consistently signed with a valid code signing certificate that the threat actor likely obtained either through certificate theft or fraud to purchase a new certificate, while subsequent modules were unsigned.\n",
            "In collaboration with Sophos, which initially found this new RomCom version in February during an incident, we investigated the malware's capabilities and gathered some knowledge about the attackers' activity on a victim’s system.\n",
            "Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the SnipBot malware through products like Cortex and Advanced WildFire, with its different memory analysis features. Advanced WildFire classifies the SnipBot malware samples in this article as malicious. Advanced URL Filtering and Advanced DNS Security classify known URLs and domains associated with this activity as malicious.\n",

            "  Backdoors ,  RomCom  \n",
            "  Malware Background\n",
            " RomCom RAT is a malware family that has evolved over the years to include different features and attack methods. The threat actor using RomCom has been active since at least 2022. They engage in ransomware, extortion and targeted credential gathering, likely to support intelligence-gathering operations. RomCom has made multiple advancements, leading to its newest iteration called SnipBot, which employs new commands and evasion techniques.\n",
            "The SnipBot variant of RomCom leverages a basic set of features that allows the attacker to run commands on a victim's system and download additional modules. The initial payload is always either an executable downloader masked as a PDF file or an actual PDF file sent to the victim in an email that leads to an executable.\n",
            "The earliest initial sample of SnipBot we found was a PDF file that shows distorted text that states a font is missing that’s needed to show it correctly. If the victim clicks on the contained link that’s purported to download and install the font package, they will instead download the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "SnipBot consists of several stages where the initial downloader is always an executable file and the remaining payloads are either EXEs or DLLs. The downloader is always signed with a legitimate and valid code signing certificate. We don’t know how the threat actors obtain these certificates, but it’s likely they steal them or gain them by fraud. Subsequent modules were not signed.\n",
            "  Email Infection Vector\n",
            "By reviewing Cortex XDR telemetry data and reverse engineering the initial sample, we were able to recreate the whole infection chain. The initial infection vector in our case was an email that contained a link that redirects twice to the SnipBot downloader.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows the chain of URLs from the initial one contained in the email to the final SnipBot downloader file link. The attacker registered the domains and . The website is a legitimate file sharing service with a set hosting period of three days.\n",
            " Figure 1. URL chain from the email to the downloader (icon sources). \n",
            "We discovered another chain of links that was likely used by the same attacker to deliver a similar SnipBot downloader variant. The distinct initial domain and the similar downloader file name imply this was part of a campaign targeting multiple victims.\n",
            "Figure 2 shows another chain of URLs used in another attack. The attacker created the domain ; it is not a legitimate file sharing service.\n",

            "  SnipBot Malware\n",
            "Figure 3 shows the infection chain of the different SnipBot stages. The initial downloader is a 64-bit Windows executable (SHA256: ) disguised as a PDF file. It is signed with a presumably stolen or spoofed certificate from , which is a company located in Denmark.\n",
            " Figure 3. SnipBot execution flow from the initial EXE downloader to the main bot file (icon sources). \n",
            "This downloader uses two simple yet effective anti-sandbox tricks. The first one checks for the original file name by comparing the hashed process name against a hard-coded value. The second one checks whether there are at least 100 entries in the registry key, which is usually the case on a regular user’s system but less likely to be the case in a sandbox system.\n",

            " Figure 4. registry key of a typical Windows system. \n",
            "The downloader is also obfuscated with a window message-based control-flow obfuscation algorithm. The malware code is split up into multiple unordered blocks that are triggered by custom window messages.\n",
            "To accomplish this, a window is created that has a callback message that contains these code blocks. The window message queue is used to call each block in its original order.\n",
            "The first message block is triggered by sending the initial message and then each block sends the next message when it’s done. Additionally, each block can also send nested messages, which makes it even more challenging to follow the execution flow.\n",
            " \n",
            "Most of the strings, such as the command and control (C2) domain name and all the names of dynamically resolved API functions, are encrypted. The threat actor likely did this to prevent easy static detection, thus making malware analysis more time-consuming.\n",
            "Upon execution, the downloader contacts the first C2 domain and tries to get a PDF file and the first payload. We couldn’t recover the original downloaded first payload, but for an unknown reason, the attacker later downloaded the same payload with different configuration data and started it manually. We were able to obtain this file and could continue our analysis.\n",
            "The threat downloads the PDF to the local user’s temporary folder with a random name before opening it. The first payload is a DLL file (internally named ) that the threat executes in memory. It has an exported function named that contains its malicious code.\n",
            "This DLL file’s purpose is to download the next stage COM DLL named from the second C2 and inject it into Explorer. For this, it uses COM hijacking to register the file as the thumbnail cache library in the registry hive of the current user.\n",
            "When restarting , the DLL gets loaded into its address space and executed. While this is a reliable method of loading a payload into Explorer, forcing it to terminate can result in a crash, as it did on the victim's machine.\n",

Enduring Legacy Of Infostealer Malware\\u2014What You Can Do\\n==========================================================\\n\\nMay 30, 2024 16:31 GMT\\n\\nDespite a relatively unsophisticated methodology by modern standards, infostealer malware is a timeless favorite of cyberattackers and data thieves. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\n![Image 10](https://innovatecybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Timeless-Legacy-of-Infostealer-Malwarewhat-you-can-do-f-800x448.jpg)\\n\\nInfostealer malware, also known as information-stealing malware, has a rich and nefarious history of cybercrime and cyberattacks. Like a sneaky robber, it hides on computers, unnoticed. Infostealer malware\\u2019s origins can be traced back to the early days of computer viruses and malware, which were particularly prevalent during the 1990s and early 2000s.\\n\\nDecades later, infostealer malware is still on the rise and continues to impact organizations through relatively unsophisticated methods, despite the maturation of the security industry. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\nOrigins of Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware, short for information-stealer, is a type of malware that primarily aims to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information. It typically targets login information, bank details, cryptocurrency wallets, and personally identifiable information such as SSNs and dates of birth. The pilfered data is a valuable resource for hackers, who may exploit it for identity theft, taking control of online profiles, or carrying out monetary assaults.\\n\\nMost often, this is accomplished via searching for file names and extensions that have been identified as valuable, as well as directly targeting applications known to contain sensitive information, mainly browsers and messaging applications.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Development\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe development and distribution of infostealer malware closely follow the rise of MaaS (malware as a service) models. These have become increasingly popular in cybercrime circles over the past few years.\\n\\nAn individual or a group creates the malware builder or executable and then offers it for sale to less experienced attackers on darknet markets or Telegram groups. This allows less-skilled attackers to distribute their purchased payload as they please, often through popular methods like phishing or malicious advertisements.\\n\\nKey Players in Infostealer Malware\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nRedline, Vidar, and Raccoon Stealers are a few notable players who have long dominated the Infostealer scene. The strains all employ similar methods: they function by dumping saved credentials, session cookies, and saved payment methods within the browser, giving attackers access to the associated accounts. Session cookies will allow attackers to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions.\\n\\nThreat actors will also attempt to hijack crypto wallets and Discord accounts, which are then used for further propagation of the malware. After taking over an infected machine\\u2019s Discord account, automated messages will be sent to the user\\u2019s contact list, prompting them to download the executable to start the cycle all over again.\\n\\nSpray and Pray\\n--------------\\n\\nIn the minds of cybersecurity professionals, infostealer malware has been disregarded as an issue for consumers rather than organizations due to its \\u201cspray-and-pray\\u201d method of infection and wide availability. However, that same logic, if reversed, is the exact reason why organizations should be aware, cautious, and prepared for these infections.\\n\\nAs with many malware types, all it takes is one wrong click on a phishing attachment or malicious advertisement to publish sensitive data such as PII or even corporate login credentials to the darknet markets. With the seemingly endless number of malicious sites and emails, infection becomes even more likely.\\n\\nRecommendations For Fighting Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStopping infostealer malware is similar to preventing typical infections from RATs or other malware. AV and EDR tools are typically tuned in to the IOCs and TTPs associated with the larger names in the infostealer scene. However, no single tool should be the only measure of prevention of infection or the mitigation of post-infection activities.\\n\\nCybersecurity threat hunters frequently observe first-hand the failings of signature-based and even behavioral or heuristic tools. This is not to say these tools are useless or unnecessary, but rather that it is crucial to implement several layers of security to prevent these infections. Adding tools such as network DLP, email attachment defenses, and proactive security monitoring/threat hunting will significantly increase the chances of stopping these attacks in their tracks.\\n\\nHere are some effective mitigations that are recommended to keep infostealer malware from gaining a hold in your environment:\\n\\n##### Email Security\\n\\nInfostealers are most commonly distributed via phishing and malspam campaigns, making email (more specifically, attachment-based security tools) a good first line of defense against these infections.\\n\\nAs a common tactic by threat actors to get around typical signature-based email attachment security, blocking emails with a.zip archive attachment from unknown senders is a good first step.\\n\\nAs always, phishing awareness training is another crucial step to prevent infection should a malicious email sneak through.\\n\\n##### Web Security\\n\\nMalvertising, or malicious advertising techniques, is another attack vector that info thieves frequently use.. These techniques employ search engine ads in order to pose as legitimate and popular software downloads, which have been replaced with an infostealer.\\n\\nWeb filtering is another tool which should be added to the lineup to prevent accidental trojanized downloads.\\n\\n##### Endpoint Protection\\n\\nAV and EDR tools provide a secondary layer of host-based detection and mitigation should a download get through the previous layers. These tools will typically detect the larger names in the infostealer scene, whether through signature-based or heuristic detections.\\n\\nA combination of both detection types is a great way to ensure malware is caught at time of download, or at runtime. However, these tools are not an end-all solution, there are many tactics that be employed by threat actors to evade these defenses.\\n\\n##### Network Security/DLP\\n\\nNetwork security tools, specifically DLP in the case of infostealers, can prevent the sensitive data collected from leaving the network and making it back to the attacker.\\n\\nDetection of exfiltration over encrypted protocols such as HTTPS can be difficult; however, some tools, such as TLS inspection, can be employed.\\n\\n##### The author\\n\\nMalachi Grimes is a Threat Analyst at

These malicious programs often operate as part of botnets, utilizing various methods to spread and evade detection.\\n*   The ReliaQuest Threat Research team identified \\u201cLummaC2,\\u201d \\u201cRedLine,\\u201d and \\u201cRaccoon\\u201d as the most prevalent infostealers in 2023, with LummaC2 nearly doubling credential sales quarter-over-quarter. We attribute their success primarily to their unusual distribution methods.\\n*   Successful data theft by infostealers can lead to severe consequences for organizations, including financial loss, intellectual property theft, and compromised sensitive data. This stolen data can also serve as initial access for further attacks.\\n*   To combat the use of infostealers, the ReliaQuest Threat Research team recommends implementing security enhancements such as certificate-based authentication for enhanced user access security, utilizing enterprise browsers with advanced security features, and establishing a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to monitor for exposed credentials.\\n\\nInfostealer malware, which covertly infiltrates systems and harvests sensitive information, poses a significant risk to individual and organizational security. Infostealers have been a persistent threat for many years, with the earliest variant, ZeuS, emerging in 2006. Since this early example, infostealers have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Cybercriminal activity involving infostealers spiked significantly from Q3 to Q4 2023: ReliaQuest noted a 30.5% increase in cybercriminal forums marketplace listings for \\u201cstealer logs\\u201d (data harvested by infostealer malware).\\n\\nThis report provides an overview of common infostealer variants; describes their targeted geographies and sectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and outlines general mitigation steps and best practices.\\n\\nInfostealers Overview\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ever-increasing complexity and prevalence of infostealer malware is fueled by the lucrative nature of stolen data, which is commonly sold on cybercriminal forums, marketplaces, and messaging applications like Telegram. Once adversaries extract valuable information, they sometimes share stealer logs for free on these platforms; subsequent resharing on other forums allows even more threat actors to access the data at no cost.\\n\\nInfostealers are designed to infiltrate computers and transmit sensitive data, including:\\n\\n*   Usernames and passwords\\n*   Cookies\\n*   Credit card data\\n*   Cryptocurrency wallets\\n*   Browser history\\n*   Hardware/software information\\n\\nThis malware typically targets credentials from online banking websites, social media platforms, email accounts, and file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts. Modern infostealers often function as part of botnets, enabling attackers to remotely connect to an infected host and transmit data via command-and-control (C2) servers. These malicious entities spread infostealers through methods like spam email attachments, compromised websites, and malware advertising, often in conjunction with other malware types such as downloaders, Trojan droppers, and keyloggers.\\n\\nStealer malware can pose big risks with profound impacts, illustrating the critical need for heightened awareness and sophisticated defense strategies. For example, the now-notorious Change Healthcare cyber attack was initiated through compromised credentials that can be sourced from infostealer malware.\\n\\nInfostealers can disproportionately affect different sectors, geographies, and technologies. Sectors handling significant sensitive information like healthcare, finance, and retail are particularly at risk. Geographically, regions that are commonly targeted for ransomware, such as the US, UK, and Canada, seem to be most at risk. The reason behind the geographical targets is highly likely due to the higher demand in compromised credentials being purchased for these regions.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a more specific look at how threat actors can maliciously leverage stolen information:\\n\\n*   **Initial access for further attacks**: Once threat actors obtain initial access through stolen data, they can use this foothold to extract more sensitive information or to introduce other malicious software, such as ransomware, into the system.\\n*   **Credential stuffing attacks**: Threat actors may use stolen credentials to perform credential stuffing attacks on corporate accounts, exploiting the common issue of password reuse across multiple platforms.\\n*   **Bank account access**: Threat actors might attempt to access bank accounts using the stolen credentials and drain the funds or use the accounts for money laundering purposes.\\n\\nWhile infostealer malware has historically targeted individuals, the threat to corporate organizations is significant and growing. The ramifications of an infostealer malware infection for organizations are profound, encompassing not only financial loss and intellectual property theft but also severe data breaches that could impact the entire organizational structure. This malware type not only facilitates financial exploitation but also serves as a gateway for further attacks, potentially leading to widespread ransomware infections.\\n\\nMost Common Infostealers in 2023\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team has compiled an overview of the most common infostealers we observed in 2023: LummaC2, RedLine, and Raccoon.\\n\\n#### LummaC2\\n\\nLummaC2 was most prevalent infostealer in 2023, according to ReliaQuest\\u2019s collection of dark web marketplace listings. In addition, the number of LummaC2-obtained logs listed for sale increased by 110% from Q3 to Q4 2023. LummaC2\\u2019s rising popularity among adversaries is likely due to its high success rate, which refers to its effectiveness in successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data without detection. Additionally, its intuitive user interface (UI) makes the tool accessible to threat actors across a wide spectrum of skill levels.\\n\\nThe pricing model for a LummaC2 subscription ranges from $250 to $1,000 per month, depending on the subscription tier selected.\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 1: LummaC2 subscription service and description_\\n\\nLummaC2 is best known for using unconventional distribution tactics, including the deployment of trojanized software files and spearphishing emails equipped with deceptive links or attachments. This method allows LummaC2 to bypass some standard security measures designed to catch more common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads.\\n\\nFurthermore, LummaC2 targets a comprehensive array of sensitive data not limited to traditional credentials. It focuses on cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and two-factor authentication (2FA) details. This targeted approach makes LummaC2 particularly perilous for businesses that manage digital assets or utilize extensive online financial services.\\n\\nLummaC2 sets itself apart in the landscape of infostealers through its broad targeting capabilities and systematic extraction methods. Capable of infiltrating a range of systems from Windows 7 to Windows 11 and compatible with at least ten different web browsers, LummaC2\\u2019s adaptability is unmatched. Its ability to target and exfiltrate data from applications related to cryptocurrency and extensions further distinguishes it as a significant threat, especially given the rising prominence of digital currencies in business operations.\\n\\nThe stealthy nature of LummaC2\\u2019s operations makes it particularly dangerous, as it can siphon sensitive information without immediate detection, multiplying the potential damage.\\n\\n#### Redline\\n\\nRedLine ranked as the second most prevalent infostealer ReliaQuest identified in 2023, with a 44% rise in listings from Q3 to Q4 2023. This growth is noteworthy, yet it falls far short of LummaC2\\u2019s growth rate. The popularity of RedLine can likely be attributed to its high success rate of exfiltrating financial data such as cryptocurrency wallets. While not as prolific as LummaC2, RedLine has made a name for itself in the cybercriminal world due to its high infection rate and more affordable malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription starting at $100 per month, as compared to competitors, most of which start at $250.\\n\\nSince its inception in March 2020, RedLine has been utilized by initial access brokers and other malicious actors on Russian-language cybercriminal forums. It specializes in exfiltrating passwords, credit card details, instant messages, and cryptocurrency wallet information. Over time, RedLine\\u2019s distribution methods have evolved from phishing emails themed around COVID-19 to using adware through malicious Google ads, weaponizing Microsoft Office documents, and targeting digital artists in the NFT space. More recently, it has adapted by masquerading as a Windows 11 upgrade tool, demonstrating its ability to exploit current trends to enhance its dissemination.\\n\\nRedLine\\u2019s extensive technical capabilities enable it to perform a variety of malicious activities that are particularly disruptive to organizations. RedLine allows adversaries to harvest system information such as browser types, FTP client details, and hardware configurations. It can perform a range of malicious activities, including uploading and downloading files, executing commands, and relaying information about compromised systems back to the attackers. Such functionalities not only allow for the theft of sensitive data but also potentially facilitate deeper network penetration and lateral movement within a corporate environment, leading to more extensive breaches and data compromise.\\n\\nRedLine differentiates itself from other prominent infostealers like LummaC2 and Raccoon through its targeting strategy and distribution techniques. RedLine has a broader target spectrum and uses more varied distribution methods. Compared to Raccoon, which also operates on a MaaS model, RedLine\\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to current trends and its lower entry price point make it accessible and dangerous.\\n\\n#### Raccoon\\n\\nReliaQuest identified Raccoon Stealer, sometimes rendered as \\u201cRacoon,\\u201d as the third most common information stealer in 2023. Despite its ranking, mentions of Raccoon on the dark web saw a drastic decrease from Q3 to Q4 2023, largely due to the arrest of Mark Sokolovsky, a pivotal figure behind Raccoon, in late 2022. This arrest disrupted operations temporarily and led to significant law enforcement scrutiny, which temporarily halted Raccoon\\u2019s activities.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is adept at stealing a wide range of data from over 60 different applications, including sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, browsing history, and cryptocurrency wallet data. In August 2023, the developers released an updated version based on user feedback and market trends. This version introduced features like an innovative URL search method for quick data access, automatic bot detection and blocking, and detailed log statistics.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer\\u2019s subscription was initially priced at $200 per month but increased to $275 in August 2023. It is also offered at $125 per week, making it accessible for short-term use.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is differentiated by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, catering to less technically skilled cybercriminals. Raccoon focuses on providing a simple yet effective tool for extensive data harvesting, making it particularly dangerous for organizations. The stealer\\u2019s ability to target a vast range of applications and its enhancements aimed at evading detection make it a formidable tool for extracting corporate data.\\n\\nThe resilience and adaptability of Raccoon Stealer, despite significant disruptions such as the arrest of its key developer, highlight the persistent threat posed by such cybercriminal tools. Organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts to defend against such sophisticated malware.\\n\\n#### LummaC2 Case Study\\n\\nIn October 2023, ReliaQuest observed in a customer environment the execution of the unauthorized file \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar,\\u201d which is associated with LummaC2. Shortly before the malicious file was downloaded, the user attempted to install a cracked license key from the license key download service \\u201chdlicense\\\\[.\\\\]com.\\u201d This redirected the user to \\u201chxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S,\\u201d where the user was prompted to download the malicious RAR file. After clicking the download prompt, the user was redirected to multiple domains, including \\u201csustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\u201d and a free file-hosting server that initiated the LummaC2 malware download.\\n\\n\\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d contained multiple files, including a legitimate, signed copy of the cross-platform media player \\u201cVLC Player\\u201d renamed as \\u201cSetup.exe\\u201d and the LummaC2 executable. The executable used a technique called Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading to import a copy of the VLC Player library (\\u201clibvlc.dll\\u201d), which then imported a malicious version of the library (\\u201clibvlccore.dll\\u201d). libvlccore.dll loaded the LummaC2 payload. Using DLL side-loading enabled the adversary to bypass security measures, execute the malware, and establish a C2 connection to \\u201chxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api.\\u201d\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers1.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 2: Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar file contents_\\n\\nIn this case study, ReliaQuest communicated to the impacted organization our recommendation to first isolate the impacted endpoint to disable any communication or active connections. We then deleted the \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d file and blocked all associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). The impacted organization rotated the user\\u2019s credentials, reimaged the endpoint, and notified the user of the organization\\u2019s acceptable use policy (AUP). Further communication with the impacted customer confirmed that no additional IOCs or C2 traffic were identified following these steps.\\n\\nThis incident showcases characteristic hallmarks of LummaC2, including the use of legitimate software to disguise malware activities and the exploitation of less secure third-party download sites. To prevent similar incidents, organizations should implement stringent controls on software downloads and installations, which in this case allowed the initial download of a cracked software key.\\n\\nBelow is a list of IoCs we observed in this case study:\\n\\n**IOC**\\n\\n**Type**\\n\\n7a35008a1a1ae3d093703c3a34a21993409af42eb61161aad1b6ae4afa8bbb70\\n\\nHash\\n\\na9e9d7770ff948bb65c0db24431f75dd934a803181afa22b6b014fac9a162dab\\n\\nHash\\n\\nhxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://download2361.mediafire\\\\[.\\\\]com/kz5hd3dkenwgED02vBaT\\\\_kwGFdmwQ1 iAY4QGf3SAcLidcmbEn-K1HrKyPpR6ADOq7VjezmdEoNhZJFB\\\\_Wze08J1MU0iH\\\\_ oPWGS6Myj12LuXef9l7y\\\\_Em63yxedx88ezRHTt44POY858wKHjwxqr2errwIun SIHwCNMWQNQPY4\\\\_0FkZKD/wt0hho282tuxy9d/Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\n\\nURL\\n\\nsustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\n\\nDomain\\n\\nThreat Forecast\\n---------------\\n\\nWe predict that in 2024, LummaC2 and RedLine activity will continue to grow. With the sales of credentials obtained via LummaC2 more than doubling from Q3 to Q4 2023, the stealer shows no signs of slowing down. RedLine, with its 44% rise in dark web marketplace presence in the same period and a diverse range of associated tactics for distribution and data theft, is highly probable to continue to grow. Its adaptability and affordability make it an attractive option for cybercriminals looking to harvest sensitive information efficiently.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the usage of Raccoon will likely continue to decline throughout 2024. The drastic decrease in mentions and sales of Raccoon stealer logs on cybercriminal forums toward the end of 2023 suggests threat actors\\u2019 waning interest in this tool. This downturn may result from its outdated evasion tactics, the emergence of more advanced stealers like LummaC2 and RedLine, and the arrest of a key figure behind Raccoon in late 2022. This arrest not only disrupted Raccoon\\u2019s operations but also exposed the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure, likely diminishing its appeal to cybercriminals.\\n\\nMitigations, Recommendations, and Best Practices\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile ReliaQuest Digital Risk Protection can alert customers when credentials appear in breaches or are sold on sites like Russian Market, we also take a more proactive approach. To identify the use of stealer malware, ReliaQuest offers detection rules. Implementing these rules will allow defenders to identify unauthorized software that violates policy obligations. These rules can be calibrated to each organization\\u2019s environment, to attain a higher level of fidelity and reduce false positives. In addition, we also provide containment and response plays for each detection rule. These automated plays can be executed by customers to mitigate threats if they are enabled.\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team offers the following inexhaustive list of recommendations and best practices to protect against infostealers\\u2019 impact.\\n\\n*   **Prevent saving of passwords in browsers**: Implement strict network policies or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable the saving of passwords in web browsers. This security measure is crucial as many infostealers target saved credentials in browsers to exfiltrate sensitive information. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance and effectiveness.\\n*   **Shorter session cookie timeouts**: Configure shorter session cookie timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking. By limiting the duration of sessions, even if an attacker gains access to session cookies, their window of opportunity is significantly reduced. This enhances overall security by forcing users to re-authenticate more frequently.\\n*   **Cert based authentication**: Adopt certificate-based authentication to strengthen the security of user access. Certificates provide a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords and are less susceptible to phishing attacks. Implementing this method can significantly improve the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive systems.\\n*   **Enterprise browsers**: Utilize enterprise browsers that offer enhanced security features tailored for organizational needs. These browsers often provide better management and security controls, including the ability to enforce policies, monitor usage, and protect against malicious websites. Integrating enterprise browsers can bolster security while maintaining user productivity.\\n*   **DRP for monitoring for exposed credentials**: Establish a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to continuously monitor for exposed credentials. DRP solutions can scan the dark web, paste sites, and other sources to detect if any corporate credentials have been compromised. Rapid detection allows for swift remediation actions, such as password resets and user notifications, to mitigate potential damage.\\n*   **Employee training and awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with infostealers. Training should cover the identification of phishing emails, suspicious links, and unusual requests that may be attempts to install malware. An informed workforce is a critical defense against social engineering attacks.\"}]\n",
