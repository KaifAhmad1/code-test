Some malware – such as IcedID and DarkGate – came up repeatedly. We also included a number of posts about the cybercrime group TA577 – who have distributed multiple malware families but here favor Pikabot. In other cases, we posted about newer malware such as JinxLoader.\n",
            "By sharing timely threat intelligence via social media channels, we report on malware infections and other threat intelligence of note in an expedited manner. These posts summarize the infection chain, offer helpful screenshots of active traffic and point towards indicators of compromise (IoCs). In 2023, our 93 timely threat intelligence posts in total generated 1.6 million-plus impressions, showing the value of getting IoCs out to the community quickly.\n",

            "Many of these posts contain screenshots of infection traffic filtered in Wireshark, links to the network IoCs and comments linking to packet captures (pcaps) of the associated activity, so this article also provides readers an opportunity to practice and improve their Wireshark skills.\n",

This type of malware can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, and personal data from compromised computers and networks. Infostealers can be installed on a computer or device via phishing attacks, infected websites, and malicious software downloads. Once installed, they can execute and exit very quickly; many infostealers finish collecting and transmitting stolen data within several seconds to a minute of total runtime. The data is then packaged and sold as logs. Threat actors could use stolen credentials in these logs to gain unauthorized access to enterprise networks via remote access services such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and Microsoft Office Web Access (OWA). This unauthorized access can result in the exfiltration of sensitive data or the deployment of ransomware, which can cause significant financial loss and reputational damage. Although the name 'infostealer' implies data theft, this malware has evolved over time to include deployment of additional tools and malware.\\n\\nUnderground forums and marketplaces\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealers are often sold as a monthly subscription service. The price can range from $50 to over $1,000 USD per month for access to a stealer command and control (C2) server operated by the developer. The service often features a range of support functions, including multiple ways to view, download, and share stolen data. Self-hosted stealer C2 servers are also available and are usually sold for a flat fee.\\n\\nUnderground forums provide a shared space for threat actors to discuss ongoing projects, request new features, and provide malware reviews. They also offer a marketplace to advertise new and existing stealers. Underground forums such as XSS . is and exploit . in are popular with threat actors involved in the development and deployment of infostealers.\\n\\nThese forums consist of subforums and sections that host a range of topics. They also contain administrative areas to control announcements, sales, and memberships. Many underground forums have a dedicated marketplace and enforce stringent rules to sell illegal products such as infostealers. Larger, high-profile forums offer an escrow service to mediate transactions between vendors and customers, building trust in the marketplace and providing a degree of control over interactions.\\n\\nStealer logs are available from underground forums, marketplaces, and other online platforms that cater to threat actors interested in obtaining credentials, financial information, personal data, banking details, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive, secret, or valuable information. These marketplaces are often only accessible through Tor or the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) anonymity services and usually have strict rules and regulations regarding the types of information that can be traded. The offerings are typically only accessible to members who have been approved by the marketplace's administrators or who pay an entry fee. Some marketplaces only sell infostealer logs and have built their infrastructure to facilitate these transactions. Other forums offer many illicit wares for sale and have sections that include logs obtained from infostealers.\\n\\nA burgeoning market also exists for after-action tools. Infostealers can lower the bar for entry to cybercrime, but the uninitiated can find the logs to be challenging to parse. Multiple vendors sell tools to assist in log parsing, enabling cybercriminals to extract data of interest from the raw logs.\\n\\n### Russian Market\\n\\nRussian Market is by far the biggest underground marketplace for infostealer logs, and it has ties to the now-defunct Amigos Marketplace. As of this publication, Russian Market offers over five million logs for sale, which is roughly ten times more than its nearest rival. Historically, the marketplace predominantly sold logs obtained through five infostealers: RedLine, Raccoon, Vidar, Taurus, and AZORult. As of late February 2023, it stopped carrying Taurus and AZORult logs. Since December 2022, researchers observed [RisePRO](https://flashpoint.io/blog/risepro-stealer-and-pay-per-install-malware-privateloader/) infostealer logs for sale through the marketplace, although total offerings remain low. Table 1 lists the number of infostealer logs for sale on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023.\\n\\n| Stealer | Number of available logs |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Raccoon | 2,114,549 |\\n| Vidar | 1,816,800 |\\n| RedLine | 1,415,458 |\\n| RisePRO | 3,833 |\\n| Total | 5,350,640 |\\n\\n_Table 1. Number of infostealer logs available for purchase on Russian Market as of the end of February 2023._\\n\\nIn October 2022, Russian Market changed its operating model to allow users to preorder credentials (see Figure 1). This feature requires that buyers deposit $1,000 USD into the site's escrow system. Buyers can then request credentials based on a domain name (from a specific organization) or a 'mask' (from a specific application). Although there are no guarantees that preorders will be fulfilled, this feature could lead to specific targeting of organizations and sectors rather than relying just on opportunistic attacks.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-01.png)  \\n_Figure 1. Russian Market interface for preorder logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Genesis Market\\n\\nGenesis Market is an invitation-only marketplace that specializes in the sale of bots rather than logs. Bots are computers that were infected with infostealer malware to steal information and the browser fingerprint from a victim's web browser. The browser fingerprint can be used to impersonate the victim and access the victim's bank accounts, take over accounts, and make fraudulent purchases. A threat actor who purchases a bot has exclusive access to the data, including updates of the victim's data from the infected device.\\n\\nGenesis Market provides a custom browser plugin to customers and distinguishes itself among the competition by including more automation for site users. These features effectively render the bots as logs, removing the need to manually parse details and lowering the technical bar to entry. As of February 2023, Genesis Market listed over 450,000 bots from nearly every country (see Figure 2).\\n\\n![Image 2](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-02.png)  \\n_Figure 2. Number of available bots for sale on Genesis Market as of February 2023. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nOn April 4, 2023, Genesis Market was the target of a coordinated international [law enforcement action](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation) led by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite the arrests of multiple users and the takedown of 11 domains, Operation Cookie Monster did not completely shutter the marketplace. As of this publication, the Tor version of Genesis Market remains operational. Logs have been added for sale since the takedown, albeit at a slower rate than usual.\\n\\n### 2easy\\n\\nThe 2easy marketplace has rapidly grown since it was established in 2018. Like Genesis Market, 2easy is automated, allowing buyers to add money to wallets and purchase logs without directly interacting with the seller. Unlike other sites, 2easy does not provide samples or previews. However, logs are [reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/2easy-now-a-significant-dark-web-marketplace-for-stolen-data/) less expensive than those on Genesis Market and Russian Market.\\n\\nThreat actors who purchase logs through the 2easy marketplace receive an archive file from the selected bot. The file's content depends on the stealer and its unique capabilities. RedLine has historically been the favorite infostealer for threat actors selling logs through 2easy, but the marketplace also sells Raccoon, Vidar, and AZORult logs. As of February 2023, 2easy offered over 750,000 logs for sale (see Figure 3).\\n\\n![Image 3](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-03.png)  \\n_Figure 3. Logs for sale on the 2easy marketplace. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nTelegram\\n--------\\n\\nAs demonstrated by the April 2023 Genesis Market takedown, one of the risks to sellers using traditional forums and marketplaces is the threat of law enforcement action. Another example was RaidForums, which was established in 2015 and became one of the most popular criminal marketplaces offering credentials and infostealers. In 2022, a coordinated international law enforcement investigation dubbed [Operation TOURNIQUET](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-world%E2%80%99s-biggest-hacker-forums-taken-down) resulted in the seizure of three domains and the arrest of RaidForums's founder and chief administrator. In addition, several cybercrime forums were [breached](https://www.securityweek.com/someone-hacking-cybercrime-forums-and-leaking-user-data/) in 2021 and their user data was stolen and either leaked or sold online. These takedowns and breaches undermine the security and integrity of the platforms and can degrade sellers' confidence in the anonymity offered by the forums. As a result, many cybercriminals use the Telegram messaging platform to advertise their services.\\n\\nTelegram is a multi-platform messaging service that has an estimated [700 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/234038/telegram-messenger-mau-users/) monthly users. Benefits of this platform for cybercriminals include its focus on privacy, encryption, and an open-source application programming interface (API) that allows 'unofficial clients' (alternative messaging apps that use Telegram's API) to communicate with the official app and web interface. The end-to-end encryption and support for private and anonymous channels are ideal for selling and trading stolen data and information. Telegram users can subscribe to channels on which owners can post content, or they can become members of groups and participate in discussions. Cybercriminals use these channels and groups to sell infostealers such as [Titan Stealer](https://www.uptycs.com/blog/titan-stealer-telegram-malware-campaign). Some channels are hidden and require specific invitations or permissions to access. There has [reportedly](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/about/news/positive-technologies-cybercrime-market-in-telegram-is-growing/) been a significant increase in the use of Telegram to sell illicit goods and services. Over 120,000 messages were published across more than 300 Telegram public channels and groups between the beginning of 2019 and the second quarter of 2022. RedLine, Anubis, SpiderMan, Oski Stealer, and Loki Stealer are prominently represented on Telegram. [RaccoonV2](https://www.esentire.com/blog/esentire-threat-intelligence-malware-analysis-raccoon-stealer-v2-0) operators extensively use Telegram for announcements, business discussions, and reporting stolen data.\\n\\nDespite the simplicity of selling goods over Telegram, it remains more popular for selling illicit goods such as drugs rather than for selling malware due to its primary function as a messaging platform. This limitation makes it difficult for sellers to migrate from traditional underground forums and marketplaces that feature advanced search capabilities and a way for sellers to build reputation, which is important when establishing trust with buyers. CTU\\u2122 researchers have observed scammers on Telegram mimicking real threat actors by creating fake profiles based on listings from forums such as Breached. This lack of reputation status and the prevalence of scammers is likely to undermine trust, preventing threat actors from fully adopting Telegram.\\n\\nInfostealer variants\\n--------------------\\n\\nInfostealers rose to prominence in 2006 with the [ZeuS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/zeus) trojan, which targeted online banking credentials. After the ZeuS source code was [leaked](https://www.theregister.com/2011/03/23/zeus_source_code_sale/) in March 2011, the creation of multiple variants boosted the popularity of this type of malware and inspired the development of infostealers with increasingly sophisticated capabilities. Some infostealers can be tailored or customized for specific targets and goals. For example, [LokiBot](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-266a) has been prominent since 2016 and was one of the first infostealers that targeted the Android operating system. The [Ducktail](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-php-variant-ducktail-infostealer-targeting-facebook-business-accounts) infostealer was first observed in 2022 and specifically targeted Facebook business accounts. Infostealers such as [BHUNT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-bhunt-malware-targets-your-crypto-wallets-and-passwords/) specialize in stealing cryptocurrency, while state-sponsored threat groups such as [IRON TILDEN](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/iron-tilden) use custom versions to conduct espionage.\\n\\nCTU researchers analyzed the Russian Market marketplace to understand each infostealer's properties and capabilities. The table in the [Appendix](https://www.secureworks.com/research/the-growing-threat-from-infostealers#appendix) compares features of the most common infostealers in 2022 but may not be a comprehensive view. Much of the information related to targeted browser extensions and applications is only found through the infostealer configurations. These configurations specify what information to extract from a compromised system, but they frequently change.\\n\\n### RedLine\\n\\nRedLine emerged in March 2020, and its logs are the best seller on Russian Market. RedLine is sold standalone or as a subscription. As of March 2023, standalone copies (the 'PRO' version) were advertised on Telegram for $900 USD, with subscriptions available for $150 per month or $400 for three months (see Figure 4). This malware steals information from web browsers, including saved credentials, autocomplete data, credit card information, and cryptocurrency wallets. While running on an infected system, RedLine takes a system inventory of the username, location data, hardware configuration, and installed security software.\\n\\n![Image 4](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-04.png)  \\n_Figure 4. RedLine Telegram channel listing prices and deals. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRedLine is distributed via [cracked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking) games, applications, and services, as well as via phishing campaigns and malicious ads. CTU researchers have observed multiple instances of threat actors using malicious Microsoft OneNote files to deliver RedLine. RedLine has also been observed using YouTube for [self-propagation](https://securelist.com/self-spreading-stealer-attacks-gamers-via-youtube/107407/) and has been linked by CTU researchers to SM Viewbot malware. SM Viewbot promotes YouTube videos to lure users who are searching for cracked software. Victims who download installers advertised in the video descriptions may infect their systems with infostealers.\\n\\nRedLine's execution process is straightforward. Once executed, the malware decodes XOR-encoded data such as the C2 server IP address and a unique ID. After the decoding process, RedLine requests configuration data from the C2 server, which instructs RedLine on what information to collect from the compromised system. Information related to the configuration data is then collected from the compromised system, converted into XML format, and transmitted to the C2 server via a Simple Object Access Protocol ([SOAP](https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_soap.asp)) message.\\n\\n### Raccoon\\n\\nThe original Raccoon Stealer emerged in 2019. It operated as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model and was advertised on underground forums. The cost was $75 USD per week or $200 per month. It did not include a distribution mechanism, so customers had to devise a method to install the infostealer on compromised systems. The Raccoon Stealer panel was hosted on a Tor site.\\n\\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the threat actors responsible for Raccoon Stealer announced that they were [shutting down](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/raccoon-stealer-malware-suspends-operations-due-to-war-in-ukraine/) their operations, implying that a group member had died. However, the threat actors released a new version of the malware named RaccoonV2 in May 2022 (see Figure 5). While Raccoon Stealer and RaccoonV2 share similar functionality, CTU analysis confirms that RaccoonV2 represents a significant rewrite of the malware.\\n\\n![Image 5](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-05.png)  \\n_Figure 5. Raccoon Stealer Telegram channel giving details of the new build. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRaccoonV2 remains under active development as of this publication. The developers encoded more of the code strings in later versions and changed the encoding method, moving from Base64 to XOR. They continually alter elements of the malware to improve defense evasion, including changes to the User-Agents and mutexes, presumably to circumvent indicator-based detections. To hinder static and dynamic analysis, updates included intermixing chunks of code with thousands of bytes of opcodes from superfluous Windows API function calls.\\n\\nThe RaccoonV2 infostealer obtains its configuration file from a hard-coded C2 server. This file specifies what data the malware should steal (e.g., password files, credit card information, web browser data, email messages, cryptocurrency wallets, browser cookies). This data is stored as individual files in the %APPDATA%\\\\\\\\LocalLow directory before it is sent to the malware C2 server via an HTTP POST request.\\n\\nRaccoonV2 has occasionally been deployed alongside other infostealers such as RedLine. It has been [observed](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/464621/0/html) downloading and executing malware such as SmokeLoader, cryptocurrency wallet hijackers, Amadey, Remcos, AZORult, Allcome Clipper, SystemBC, and cryptocurrency miners.\\n\\n### Vidar\\n\\nVidar primarily operates as an infostealer but has also been used to deploy ransomware. The malware was first observed in 2019 during a prolific malvertising [campaign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/01/vidar-gandcrab-stealer-and-ransomware-combo-observed-in-the-wild) where threat actors used the Fallout exploit kit to distribute Vidar and GandCrab as secondary payloads. Vidar is sold on underground forums and Telegram channels (see Figure 6) as a standalone product, usually for between $130 USD per week to $750 for three months. Vidar provides an admin panel that lets customers configure the malware and monitor infections (see Figure 7).\\n\\n![Image 6](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-06.png)  \\n_Figure 6. Vidar Telegram channel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n![Image 7](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-07.png)  \\n_Figure 7. Vidar infostealer admin panel. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nVidar is a Windows-based stealer that is written in C++ and based on the Arkei stealer. It steals system data such as machine ID, operating system, computer name, display resolution, keyboard language, hardware information, network information, and a list of installed software. Vidar can extract browser artifacts, the contents of some cryptocurrency wallets, PayPal data, session data, and screenshots.\\n\\nIn addition to stealing sensitive data, Vidar can deliver secondary payloads such as the SystemBC proxy malware. Because Vidar is available to any paying threat actor, the delivery method varies and may include phishing emails or pirated software.\\n\\nIn early 2022, CTU researchers observed Vidar creating profiles on the Mastodon social networking platform to obtain and post C2 IP addresses. The Mastodon sites used by Vidar have thousands of members, and it is unlikely that the threat actors manage or control the infrastructure. Vidar verifies that the compromised system is not located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by checking the computer language and keyboard settings. It then contacts the C2 server, which responds with the malware configuration. Vidar exfiltrates host and system information from infected devices and sends the data to the C2 server via HTTP form data POST requests.\\n\\n### Taurus\\n\\nThe 'Taurus Project,' as the infostealer was named by its developers, was first observed in the second quarter of 2020. It is the fourth-most prolific stealer on Russian Market, even though it has been inactive since late 2021. Taurus was primarily advertised on Russian-language forums and will not execute within CIS countries. There are [indications](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/threat-intelligence-report-project-taurus-infostealer-follows-in-predator-the-thiefs-footprints.pdf) that the group responsible for this malware was also responsible for the 'Predator the Thief' infostealer, either directly or through the sale of the original software to a third party. Taurus can steal VPN credentials, social media details, cryptocurrency credentials; take screenshots of the victim's desktop; and exfiltrate the system's software installation and configuration information. This data can be used to further exploit the compromised system. Taurus includes a dashboard that lets threat actors monitor infections by geographic region and customize the malware configuration to specify targeted information.\\n\\nTaurus was predominantly distributed via spam emails containing a malicious attachment. Opening the attached document prompts the victim to enable macros, which then executes a PowerShell script that initiates the download of additional payloads. Stolen data is exfiltrated as a ZIP file to a C2 server whose URL is built at runtime. Figure 8 shows the infection process.\\n\\n![Image 8](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-08.png)  \\n_Figure 8. Infection process for the Taurus infostealer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Rhadamanthys\\n\\nThe Rhadamanthys infostealer was first observed in the third quarter of 2022. It quickly established its reputation on underground forums due to the active development and deployment of user-friendly features that align with market demands. Rhadamanthys targets a wide range of applications, wallets, and user data on an infected device. The developers appear receptive to suggestions for regular updates and enhancements (see Figure 9). Rhadamanthys operates using a MaaS model and has been observed using phishing emails and Google Ads as the initial infection vector.\\n\\n![Image 9](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-09.png)  \\n_Figure 9. Forum post announcing Rhadamanthys updates. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nCTU researchers observed a threat actor named \\\"kingcrete2022\\\" advertising Rhadamanthys in September 2022 for $250 USD for 30 days or $550 for 90 days, payable in Monero or Bitcoin. In November 2022, a threat actor named 'Kingcrete' uploaded [two videos](https://vimeo.com/user185512701) to Vimeo. One video was an overview of the 'v0.3.2 updates.' The second video was named 'Wallter Crack and Customized Dictionaries' and showed how the infostealer targets cryptocurrency wallets. Both videos show details of the Rhadamanthys admin panel and a walkthrough of how it is used.\\n\\nRhadamanthys is written in C++. It evades detection by operating in system memory and by creating a mutex to ensure that only one instance is running. It uses the Al-Khaser anti-analysis tool to detect and avoid running in researcher sandboxes and virtual machines (VMs). Rhadamanthys is custom-packed with several stages that include dropping a custom loader DLL that decodes and executes an encoded payload via a command-line argument. The custom loader executes shellcode in a novel way by abusing the callback mechanism of the Windows CryptEnumOIDInfo() function and masquerades as a Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) installer running the PrintUIEntry export (see Figure 10).\\n\\n![Image 10](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-10.png)  \\n_Figure 10. Example of Rhadamanthys masquerading as an NSIS installer. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nRhadamanthys decodes the C2 URL used for initial communication using a generated 128-byte XOR key. The configuration file it receives from the C2 server is disguised as a JFIF image via [steganography](https://blog.cyble.com/2023/01/12/rhadamanthys-new-stealer-spreading-through-google-ads/). The infostealer uses the [WebSocket](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2023/01/03/index.html) protocol to encrypt post-infection traffic, which includes stolen and exfiltrated data. Rhadamanthys can also be configured to run arbitrary executables.\\n\\n### State-sponsored stealers\\n\\nInfostealers are not exclusively used by cybercriminals. Because infostealers can discreetly and efficiently exfiltrate sensitive data from targeted systems, they are commonly and effectively used by state-sponsored threat groups that focus on cyberespionage operations. During the conflict in Ukraine, Russian threat actors deployed the [Graphiron](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/new-infostealer-discovered-russia/) infostealer to target Ukrainian organizations. This infostealer is similar to the [GraphSteel](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/spear-phish-ukrainian-entities) malware previously used against Ukraine but includes enhanced capabilities. Graphiron is Go-based malware that can steal system and application data, screenshots, account credentials, and private keys. It consists of a downloader and a secondary information-stealing payload. The downloader checks for various security software and malware analysis tools before downloading the payload. Graphiron uses AES encryption with hard-coded keys to communicate with the C2 server through port 443.\\n\\nChinese state-sponsored threat groups have also been observed using infostealers in pursuit of their objectives. Reports of a 2022 espionage campaign targeting various government and public entities in Asia identified a custom [Infostealer.Logdatter](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/espionage-asia-governments) infostealer that logged keystrokes, captured screenshots, stole clipboard data, downloaded files, injected code, and both connected to and queried SQL databases. This campaign has been attributed to the [BRONZE ATLAS](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/bronze-atlas) threat group.\\n\\nThe infostealer ecosystem\\n-------------------------\\n\\nMuch like the general cybercriminal ecosystem, the successful development and deployment of infostealers relies on individuals with a broad range of skills, roles, and responsibilities. These individuals include developers, initial access brokers (IABs), and customers (see Figure 11). The rise of MaaS operations has lowered the technical barrier to entry into cybercrime. It has also fostered innovation among developers as they improve their products and appeal to a broad audience of potential customers on underground forums and marketplaces.\\n\\n![Image 11](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-11.png)  \\n_Figure 11. An overview of roles and relationships in the infostealer ecosystem. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\n### Developers\\n\\nMalware developers are responsible for writing and maintaining the code that will be packaged and sold on underground forums, typically to IABs. With MaaS being the most common business model in the infostealer marketplace, developers can dedicate more time and effort to ensuring their malware contains a range of features, taking feedback from users, and iterating the malware to constantly evolve and improve. Forums allow customers to leave feedback, enhancing the seller's reputation and potentially increasing the popularity of the malware.\\n\\n### Initial access brokers\\n\\nIABs are individuals or groups that rent access to tools from MaaS operators on underground forums and marketplaces. They then deploy these infostealers via phishing or malicious ad campaigns to infect systems. These infostealers steal data from the compromised system and exfiltrate it to a C2 server. This stolen data, typically including credentials for services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), VPNs, email accounts, and cryptocurrency wallets, is then sold to threat actors who use it for malicious purposes.\\n\\n### Customers\\n\\nDue to diverse types of data that infostealers can obtain from a compromised system, threat actors often purchase the data for a wide range of purposes. Financially motivated cybercriminals may purchase credentials for cryptocurrency wallets, online banking, or other financial services and abuse them to make fraudulent withdrawals or transactions. Ransomware groups commonly seek infostealer logs, as credentials for RDP, VPNs, and corporate accounts can provide initial access into enterprises prior to data exfiltration and encryption. The value of infostealers to ransomware groups has increased with the success of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and the growth of 'hack-and-leak' sites. For example, the LockBit ransomware operators [reportedly](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1587887149411536896) offered to purchase the Raccoon Stealer source code.\\n\\n### Specialist log parsers\\n\\nLog marketplaces such as Genesis Market have built-in parsing as a browser extension, which allows customers to seamlessly access device fingerprints and victim data. Other marketplaces like Russian Market and 2easy sell raw logs that require parsing to interpret and use the content. Parsing infostealer logs purchased from a underground marketplace can be a complex task, as the logs are often in various formats and contain a large amount of data. This challenge has created a secondary market for individuals selling parser tools to customers who have either deployed the infostealers and want to sell structured data or to buyers in possession of bulk raw logs (see Figures 12 and 13).\\n\\n![Image 12](https://www.secureworks.com/-/media/images/insights/resources/threat-analysis/2023/infostealers/growing-threat-from-infostealers-figure-12.png)  \\n_Figure 12.

Threat actor selling a parser for large batches of stealer logs. (Source: Secureworks)_\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nIn 2022, stolen credentials [featured heavily](https://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-irs-learning-from-incident-response-team-2022-year-in-review) in Secureworks incident response engagements. Infostealer malware poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations. Its ability to steal sensitive information such as passwords and financial information has far-reaching consequences for victims. This type of malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult for victims to detect and remove. Additionally, the evolution of criminal marketplaces allows relatively low-skilled threat actors to access tools with advanced capabilities to attack many victims.\\n\\nThe migration to remote work driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and sustained post-pandemic exposes users and organizations to even greater risk from infostealers. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies that let users access corporate assets from infected personal devices can lead to compromises of corporate systems.\\n\\nTo mitigate this threat, individuals and organizations must take proactive steps to secure their systems. These steps include keeping software up to date, using strong and unique passwords that must not be stored in web browsers, and being wary of suspicious emails or downloads. It is also crucial to invest in security solutions that can detect and block infostealer malware. By taking these actions, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of compromise.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\nAbrams, Lawrence. \\u201cRaccoon Stealer malware suspends operations due to war in Ukraine.\\u201d Bleeping Computer.

See which stealers dominate the market\", \"content\": \"The Cybercrime world changes rapidly \\u2013 both by expanding, collapsing, and evolving extensively and intensively. One of the most massive malware types in the modern threat landscape \\u2013 **Infostealer Malware** \\u2013 appears to enter a new stage of development. Though its major names remain the same, some new malware families with promising features popped out. Let\\u2019s have a peek at all of them and see what to expect.\\n\\n[Infostealer Malware Market in 2024](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-in-2024)[Infostealer Malware Market Leaders](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#infostealer-malware-market-leaders)[RedLine Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#redline-infostealer)[Raccoon Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#raccoon-infostealer)[Vidar Infostealer](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#vidar-infostealer)[Newbies](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#newbies)[Lumma](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#lumma)[Stealc](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#stealc)[How to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/infostealer-malware-top/#how-to-protect-against-infostealer-malware)\\n\\nInfostealer malware gained more and more popularity during the last decade. However, the biggest spike happened during the last few years. The first noticeable factor is the massive popularisation of cryptocurrencies. How is that related? Well, relatively big amounts of money always attracted the attention of hackers. Carding and banking fraud though is now less effective as banks implemented strict controlling measures back in the early \\u201810s. Cryptocurrency wallets, on the other hand, have low to no control, making them ideal targets for Infostealer.\\n\\n![Image 1: Infostealer Malware stats](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/stealer-activity-2022.webp)\\n\\nAnother reason that made spyware and infostealers so popular and widespread is **their massive application in attacks on corporations**. Even when hackers break into the network to cipher the files and ask for a ransom for their decryption, they also drop an Infostealer malware that will exfiltrate as much valuable information as possible. Afterwards, [hackers request an additional ransom](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/top-famous-ransomware-groups-2022/) to keep this data secret. Some attacks are based exclusively on stealers, and the result of their job is both sold on the Darknet or used for business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Additionally, some ransomware groups that aim at home users started adding spyware to their attack chain a while ago.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Market Leaders\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAs of May 2024, 3 major malware families dominate the market \\u2013 [RedLine](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/redline), [Raccoon](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/raccoon-stealer), and [Vidar](https://gridinsoft.com/spyware/vidar). All of them are not new at that point of time, with Vidar being active for the longest time. Let\\u2019s have a closer look at them, starting with the youngest one.\\n\\n### RedLine Infostealer\\n\\n**RedLine infostealer appeared in 2020**, and saw a pretty wide application in different cyberattacks. Most of the time, however, it was aimed against single users, as its functionality fits best for this purpose. Key targets for the RedLine are cryptocurrency wallet data, both from desktop versions and browser plugins. Still, it can gather other data, like FTP/VPN configurations and session tokens for apps like Discord or Steam. Having a pretty large market share at the edge of 2024, it became much less active starting from March 2024. Yet [an enormous number of new samples](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/redline-stealer-100000-samples/) that popped out recently may be the sign of another campaign getting ready. The RedLine developers find hackers who buy this malware is through Telegram groups and Darknet forums.\\n\\n![Image 2: Redline promotion in Telegram](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/redline-tg-promo.webp)\\n\\nTelegram group post that advertises Redline malware\\n\\n### Raccoon Infostealer\\n\\nRaccoon has key properties similar to ones RedLine offers, but is capable of capturing a much wider selection of data. In its scope are **browser autofill files, cookies, and online banking credentials**, on top of the ability to pluck cryptocurrency wallets. Since the emergence in early 2019, Raccoon was holding dominant positions on the market \\u2013 and keeps holding them even now. In the summer 2022, its developers released a new version, promising faster and more reliable malware for a slightly bigger pay. Same as RedLine, Raccoon stealer is commonly spread through ads in Telegram channels and bots; [Darknet platforms are less preferred](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/malware-propagation-darknet/), though are used for public communication.\\n\\n![Image 3: Raccoon stealer admin panel](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/raccoon-admin-panel.webp)\\n\\nAdmin panel of Raccoon stealer\\n\\n### Vidar Infostealer\\n\\nAmong top 3 Infostealer threats, Vidar is most definitely a dark horse. It is considered to be an offspring of **Arkei stealer**, malware that made quite an image back in early 10\\u2019s. After the launch in 2018, it never had a dominant share on the market, being at best #2. Nonetheless, its efficiency and unique design is hard to deny \\u2013 Vidar offers a modular approach towards data stealing and has an uncommon way of C2 communication. It also performs self-destruction after the successful data exfiltration. Additionally, it is often spread in a bundle with other malware, [such as STOP/Djvu ransomware](https://gridinsoft.com/ransomware/djvu). Methods of selling it to cybercriminals, however, are less unique \\u2013 it uses Telegram channels dedicated to malware promotion.\\n\\nNewbies\\n-------\\n\\nIt would be quite reckless to deny the importance of new malware. For sure, not all of them will make it even to the 1-year milestone, but Raccoon and Vidar once were newbies as well \\u2013 and you can see where they are. Among stealer families that popped out over the last year, there are a couple you should keep in mind.\\n\\n### Lumma\\n\\nAlso known as LummaC2, this infostealer appeared in December 2022. At the outset of familiarity with this malware, you can already see some fairly noteworthy details. At the \\u201cpricing plans\\u201d panel, developers mention the ability to configure the payload in a specific manner, and add network sniffer functionality. The presence of these functions depends on the price of the chosen plan \\u2013 **$250, $500 or $1,000**. Additionally, masters offer access to malware and panel source codes and the right to sell them \\u2013 for $20,000. Other functions, however, are available regardless of the plan. Lumma can grab browser cookies, autofill forms, data from 2FA plugins/apps, and crypto wallets credentials \\u2013 from both apps and browser plugins.\\n\\n![Image 4: Lumma infostealer pricing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lummac2-pricings.webp)\\n\\nPricings for different LummaC2 stealer plans, posted on the Darknet website\\n\\n### Stealc\\n\\nStealc is another youngster, which was first mentioned on January 9, 2023, on several Darknet forums. It appears to utilise best practices from most popular stealers, which already makes it pretty potent. Among unusual practices is a free test and weekly releases of new features. As for other functions, malware has a classic set of a modern infostealer: it gathers data from web browsers (cookies, autofill forms etc), cryptocurrency wallets extensions and even email clients and messengers. Such extended functionality, especially compared to other new malware examples, will definitely be appreciated.\\n\\nHow to Protect Against Infostealer Malware?\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nProtection against threats like infostealer is always a tough question to answer. Thing is, malware like this is forced to evolve constantly, finding new ways to be more efficient and stealthy. This makes any advice that reacts to some malware features useless in the long-term. However, there are still some things Infostealer Malware developers can\\u2019t (or don\\u2019t want to) change.\\n\\n**Beware of [spear phishing](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/spear-phishing/).** It may have different forms \\u2013 from email messages that are sent from a compromised business email to posts in social media from the hijacked account of a legit company. But even after all the sophistications, hackers can never make a check-proof legend. Most commonly, they attract victims by urgent events or exclusive deals. A simple source check will reveal any possible scam \\u2013 if the impersonated company has nothing to do with such claims, ignore the spooking message.\\n\\n**Avoid using pirated software.** Despite losing a significant portion of market share due to email spam expansion, software cracks are still used for malware spreading. Torrent-trackers and third party websites are flooded with numerous offers on a brand new software \\u2013 and try to guess which one is infected. Using only licensed software will not make you clear before the law, but also nail any risk of malware injection. And, believe me \\u2013 dealing with malware activity consequences will cost you way more than you can save on program licences.\\n\\n**Protect your system with proper anti-malware software.** Yes, it is better to avoid muddy waters at all, but having a security tool that will take care of problems will make your life much easier. Not any utility will fit though, as infostealer malware have some tricks to avoid basic anti-malware software. GridinSoft Anti-Malware gives them no chances, thanks to its three-component detection system and constant updates that retain its databases\\u2019 relevance.\\n\\n[![Image 5: What is Infostealer Malware?

Enduring Legacy Of Infostealer Malware\\u2014What You Can Do\\n==========================================================\\n\\nMay 30, 2024 16:31 GMT\\n\\nDespite a relatively unsophisticated methodology by modern standards, infostealer malware is a timeless favorite of cyberattackers and data thieves. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\n![Image 10](https://innovatecybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Timeless-Legacy-of-Infostealer-Malwarewhat-you-can-do-f-800x448.jpg)\\n\\nInfostealer malware, also known as information-stealing malware, has a rich and nefarious history of cybercrime and cyberattacks. Like a sneaky robber, it hides on computers, unnoticed. Infostealer malware\\u2019s origins can be traced back to the early days of computer viruses and malware, which were particularly prevalent during the 1990s and early 2000s.\\n\\nDecades later, infostealer malware is still on the rise and continues to impact organizations through relatively unsophisticated methods, despite the maturation of the security industry. Why is this, and what can be done?\\n\\nOrigins of Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------\\n\\nInfostealer malware, short for information-stealer, is a type of malware that primarily aims to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information. It typically targets login information, bank details, cryptocurrency wallets, and personally identifiable information such as SSNs and dates of birth. The pilfered data is a valuable resource for hackers, who may exploit it for identity theft, taking control of online profiles, or carrying out monetary assaults.\\n\\nMost often, this is accomplished via searching for file names and extensions that have been identified as valuable, as well as directly targeting applications known to contain sensitive information, mainly browsers and messaging applications.\\n\\nInfostealer Malware Development\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe development and distribution of infostealer malware closely follow the rise of MaaS (malware as a service) models. These have become increasingly popular in cybercrime circles over the past few years.\\n\\nAn individual or a group creates the malware builder or executable and then offers it for sale to less experienced attackers on darknet markets or Telegram groups. This allows less-skilled attackers to distribute their purchased payload as they please, often through popular methods like phishing or malicious advertisements.\\n\\nKey Players in Infostealer Malware\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nRedline, Vidar, and Raccoon Stealers are a few notable players who have long dominated the Infostealer scene. The strains all employ similar methods: they function by dumping saved credentials, session cookies, and saved payment methods within the browser, giving attackers access to the associated accounts. Session cookies will allow attackers to bypass multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions.\\n\\nThreat actors will also attempt to hijack crypto wallets and Discord accounts, which are then used for further propagation of the malware. After taking over an infected machine\\u2019s Discord account, automated messages will be sent to the user\\u2019s contact list, prompting them to download the executable to start the cycle all over again.\\n\\nSpray and Pray\\n--------------\\n\\nIn the minds of cybersecurity professionals, infostealer malware has been disregarded as an issue for consumers rather than organizations due to its \\u201cspray-and-pray\\u201d method of infection and wide availability. However, that same logic, if reversed, is the exact reason why organizations should be aware, cautious, and prepared for these infections.\\n\\nAs with many malware types, all it takes is one wrong click on a phishing attachment or malicious advertisement to publish sensitive data such as PII or even corporate login credentials to the darknet markets. With the seemingly endless number of malicious sites and emails, infection becomes even more likely.\\n\\nRecommendations For Fighting Infostealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nStopping infostealer malware is similar to preventing typical infections from RATs or other malware. AV and EDR tools are typically tuned in to the IOCs and TTPs associated with the larger names in the infostealer scene. However, no single tool should be the only measure of prevention of infection or the mitigation of post-infection activities.\\n\\nCybersecurity threat hunters frequently observe first-hand the failings of signature-based and even behavioral or heuristic tools. This is not to say these tools are useless or unnecessary, but rather that it is crucial to implement several layers of security to prevent these infections. Adding tools such as network DLP, email attachment defenses, and proactive security monitoring/threat hunting will significantly increase the chances of stopping these attacks in their tracks.\\n\\nHere are some effective mitigations that are recommended to keep infostealer malware from gaining a hold in your environment:\\n\\n##### Email Security\\n\\nInfostealers are most commonly distributed via phishing and malspam campaigns, making email (more specifically, attachment-based security tools) a good first line of defense against these infections.\\n\\nAs a common tactic by threat actors to get around typical signature-based email attachment security, blocking emails with a.zip archive attachment from unknown senders is a good first step.\\n\\nAs always, phishing awareness training is another crucial step to prevent infection should a malicious email sneak through.\\n\\n##### Web Security\\n\\nMalvertising, or malicious advertising techniques, is another attack vector that info thieves frequently use.. These techniques employ search engine ads in order to pose as legitimate and popular software downloads, which have been replaced with an infostealer.\\n\\nWeb filtering is another tool which should be added to the lineup to prevent accidental trojanized downloads.\\n\\n##### Endpoint Protection\\n\\nAV and EDR tools provide a secondary layer of host-based detection and mitigation should a download get through the previous layers. These tools will typically detect the larger names in the infostealer scene, whether through signature-based or heuristic detections.\\n\\nA combination of both detection types is a great way to ensure malware is caught at time of download, or at runtime. However, these tools are not an end-all solution, there are many tactics that be employed by threat actors to evade these defenses.\\n\\n##### Network Security/DLP\\n\\nNetwork security tools, specifically DLP in the case of infostealers, can prevent the sensitive data collected from leaving the network and making it back to the attacker.\\n\\nDetection of exfiltration over encrypted protocols such as HTTPS can be difficult; however, some tools, such as TLS inspection, can be employed.\\n\\n##### The author\\n\\nMalachi Grimes is a Threat Analyst at

We attribute their success primarily to their unusual distribution methods.\\n*   Successful data theft by infostealers can lead to severe consequences for organizations, including financial loss, intellectual property theft, and compromised sensitive data. This stolen data can also serve as initial access for further attacks.\\n*   To combat the use of infostealers, the ReliaQuest Threat Research team recommends implementing security enhancements such as certificate-based authentication for enhanced user access security, utilizing enterprise browsers with advanced security features, and establishing a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to monitor for exposed credentials.\\n\\nInfostealer malware, which covertly infiltrates systems and harvests sensitive information, poses a significant risk to individual and organizational security. Infostealers have been a persistent threat for many years, with the earliest variant, ZeuS, emerging in 2006. Since this early example, infostealers have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Cybercriminal activity involving infostealers spiked significantly from Q3 to Q4 2023: ReliaQuest noted a 30.5% increase in cybercriminal forums marketplace listings for \\u201cstealer logs\\u201d (data harvested by infostealer malware).\\n\\nThis report provides an overview of common infostealer variants; describes their targeted geographies and sectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and outlines general mitigation steps and best practices.\\n\\nInfostealers Overview\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ever-increasing complexity and prevalence of infostealer malware is fueled by the lucrative nature of stolen data, which is commonly sold on cybercriminal forums, marketplaces, and messaging applications like Telegram. Once adversaries extract valuable information, they sometimes share stealer logs for free on these platforms; subsequent resharing on other forums allows even more threat actors to access the data at no cost.\\n\\nInfostealers are designed to infiltrate computers and transmit sensitive data, including:\\n\\n*   Usernames and passwords\\n*   Cookies\\n*   Credit card data\\n*   Cryptocurrency wallets\\n*   Browser history\\n*   Hardware/software information\\n\\nThis malware typically targets credentials from online banking websites, social media platforms, email accounts, and file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts. Modern infostealers often function as part of botnets, enabling attackers to remotely connect to an infected host and transmit data via command-and-control (C2) servers. These malicious entities spread infostealers through methods like spam email attachments, compromised websites, and malware advertising, often in conjunction with other malware types such as downloaders, Trojan droppers, and keyloggers.\\n\\nStealer malware can pose big risks with profound impacts, illustrating the critical need for heightened awareness and sophisticated defense strategies. For example, the now-notorious Change Healthcare cyber attack was initiated through compromised credentials that can be sourced from infostealer malware.\\n\\nInfostealers can disproportionately affect different sectors, geographies, and technologies. Sectors handling significant sensitive information like healthcare, finance, and retail are particularly at risk. Geographically, regions that are commonly targeted for ransomware, such as the US, UK, and Canada, seem to be most at risk. The reason behind the geographical targets is highly likely due to the higher demand in compromised credentials being purchased for these regions.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a more specific look at how threat actors can maliciously leverage stolen information:\\n\\n*   **Initial access for further attacks**: Once threat actors obtain initial access through stolen data, they can use this foothold to extract more sensitive information or to introduce other malicious software, such as ransomware, into the system.\\n*   **Credential stuffing attacks**: Threat actors may use stolen credentials to perform credential stuffing attacks on corporate accounts, exploiting the common issue of password reuse across multiple platforms.\\n*   **Bank account access**: Threat actors might attempt to access bank accounts using the stolen credentials and drain the funds or use the accounts for money laundering purposes.\\n\\nWhile infostealer malware has historically targeted individuals, the threat to corporate organizations is significant and growing. The ramifications of an infostealer malware infection for organizations are profound, encompassing not only financial loss and intellectual property theft but also severe data breaches that could impact the entire organizational structure. This malware type not only facilitates financial exploitation but also serves as a gateway for further attacks, potentially leading to widespread ransomware infections.\\n\\nMost Common Infostealers in 2023\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team has compiled an overview of the most common infostealers we observed in 2023: LummaC2, RedLine, and Raccoon.\\n\\n#### LummaC2\\n\\nLummaC2 was most prevalent infostealer in 2023, according to ReliaQuest\\u2019s collection of dark web marketplace listings. In addition, the number of LummaC2-obtained logs listed for sale increased by 110% from Q3 to Q4 2023. LummaC2\\u2019s rising popularity among adversaries is likely due to its high success rate, which refers to its effectiveness in successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data without detection. Additionally, its intuitive user interface (UI) makes the tool accessible to threat actors across a wide spectrum of skill levels.\\n\\nThe pricing model for a LummaC2 subscription ranges from $250 to $1,000 per month, depending on the subscription tier selected.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 1: LummaC2 subscription service and description_\\n\\nLummaC2 is best known for using unconventional distribution tactics, including the deployment of trojanized software files and spearphishing emails equipped with deceptive links or attachments. This method allows LummaC2 to bypass some standard security measures designed to catch more common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads.\\n\\nFurthermore, LummaC2 targets a comprehensive array of sensitive data not limited to traditional credentials. It focuses on cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and two-factor authentication (2FA) details. This targeted approach makes LummaC2 particularly perilous for businesses that manage digital assets or utilize extensive online financial services.\\n\\nLummaC2 sets itself apart in the landscape of infostealers through its broad targeting capabilities and systematic extraction methods. Capable of infiltrating a range of systems from Windows 7 to Windows 11 and compatible with at least ten different web browsers, LummaC2\\u2019s adaptability is unmatched. Its ability to target and exfiltrate data from applications related to cryptocurrency and extensions further distinguishes it as a significant threat, especially given the rising prominence of digital currencies in business operations.\\n\\nThe stealthy nature of LummaC2\\u2019s operations makes it particularly dangerous, as it can siphon sensitive information without immediate detection, multiplying the potential damage.\\n\\n#### Redline\\n\\nRedLine ranked as the second most prevalent infostealer ReliaQuest identified in 2023, with a 44% rise in listings from Q3 to Q4 2023. This growth is noteworthy, yet it falls far short of LummaC2\\u2019s growth rate. The popularity of RedLine can likely be attributed to its high success rate of exfiltrating financial data such as cryptocurrency wallets. While not as prolific as LummaC2, RedLine has made a name for itself in the cybercriminal world due to its high infection rate and more affordable malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription starting at $100 per month, as compared to competitors, most of which start at $250.\\n\\nSince its inception in March 2020, RedLine has been utilized by initial access brokers and other malicious actors on Russian-language cybercriminal forums. It specializes in exfiltrating passwords, credit card details, instant messages, and cryptocurrency wallet information. Over time, RedLine\\u2019s distribution methods have evolved from phishing emails themed around COVID-19 to using adware through malicious Google ads, weaponizing Microsoft Office documents, and targeting digital artists in the NFT space. More recently, it has adapted by masquerading as a Windows 11 upgrade tool, demonstrating its ability to exploit current trends to enhance its dissemination.\\n\\nRedLine\\u2019s extensive technical capabilities enable it to perform a variety of malicious activities that are particularly disruptive to organizations. RedLine allows adversaries to harvest system information such as browser types, FTP client details, and hardware configurations. It can perform a range of malicious activities, including uploading and downloading files, executing commands, and relaying information about compromised systems back to the attackers. Such functionalities not only allow for the theft of sensitive data but also potentially facilitate deeper network penetration and lateral movement within a corporate environment, leading to more extensive breaches and data compromise.\\n\\nRedLine differentiates itself from other prominent infostealers like LummaC2 and Raccoon through its targeting strategy and distribution techniques. RedLine has a broader target spectrum and uses more varied distribution methods. Compared to Raccoon, which also operates on a MaaS model, RedLine\\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to current trends and its lower entry price point make it accessible and dangerous.\\n\\n#### Raccoon\\n\\nReliaQuest identified Raccoon Stealer, sometimes rendered as \\u201cRacoon,\\u201d as the third most common information stealer in 2023. Despite its ranking, mentions of Raccoon on the dark web saw a drastic decrease from Q3 to Q4 2023, largely due to the arrest of Mark Sokolovsky, a pivotal figure behind Raccoon, in late 2022. This arrest disrupted operations temporarily and led to significant law enforcement scrutiny, which temporarily halted Raccoon\\u2019s activities.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is adept at stealing a wide range of data from over 60 different applications, including sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, browsing history, and cryptocurrency wallet data. In August 2023, the developers released an updated version based on user feedback and market trends. This version introduced features like an innovative URL search method for quick data access, automatic bot detection and blocking, and detailed log statistics.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer\\u2019s subscription was initially priced at $200 per month but increased to $275 in August 2023. It is also offered at $125 per week, making it accessible for short-term use.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is differentiated by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, catering to less technically skilled cybercriminals. Raccoon focuses on providing a simple yet effective tool for extensive data harvesting, making it particularly dangerous for organizations. The stealer\\u2019s ability to target a vast range of applications and its enhancements aimed at evading detection make it a formidable tool for extracting corporate data.\\n\\nThe resilience and adaptability of Raccoon Stealer, despite significant disruptions such as the arrest of its key developer, highlight the persistent threat posed by such cybercriminal tools. Organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts to defend against such sophisticated malware.\\n\\n#### LummaC2 Case Study\\n\\nIn October 2023, ReliaQuest observed in a customer environment the execution of the unauthorized file \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar,\\u201d which is associated with LummaC2. Shortly before the malicious file was downloaded, the user attempted to install a cracked license key from the license key download service \\u201chdlicense\\\\[.\\\\]com.\\u201d This redirected the user to \\u201chxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S,\\u201d where the user was prompted to download the malicious RAR file. After clicking the download prompt, the user was redirected to multiple domains, including \\u201csustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\u201d and a free file-hosting server that initiated the LummaC2 malware download.\\n\\n\\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d contained multiple files, including a legitimate, signed copy of the cross-platform media player \\u201cVLC Player\\u201d renamed as \\u201cSetup.exe\\u201d and the LummaC2 executable. The executable used a technique called Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading to import a copy of the VLC Player library (\\u201clibvlc.dll\\u201d), which then imported a malicious version of the library (\\u201clibvlccore.dll\\u201d). libvlccore.dll loaded the LummaC2 payload. Using DLL side-loading enabled the adversary to bypass security measures, execute the malware, and establish a C2 connection to \\u201chxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api.\\u201d\\n\\n![Image 2](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers1.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 2: Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar file contents_\\n\\nIn this case study, ReliaQuest communicated to the impacted organization our recommendation to first isolate the impacted endpoint to disable any communication or active connections. We then deleted the \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d file and blocked all associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). The impacted organization rotated the user\\u2019s credentials, reimaged the endpoint, and notified the user of the organization\\u2019s acceptable use policy (AUP). Further communication with the impacted customer confirmed that no additional IOCs or C2 traffic were identified following these steps.\\n\\nThis incident showcases characteristic hallmarks of LummaC2, including the use of legitimate software to disguise malware activities and the exploitation of less secure third-party download sites. To prevent similar incidents, organizations should implement stringent controls on software downloads and installations, which in this case allowed the initial download of a cracked software key.\\n\\nBelow is a list of IoCs we observed in this case study:\\n\\n| **IOC** | **Type** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 7a35008a1a1ae3d093703c3a34a21993409af42eb61161aad1b6ae4afa8bbb70 | Hash |\\n| a9e9d7770ff948bb65c0db24431f75dd934a803181afa22b6b014fac9a162dab | Hash |\\n| hxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api | URL |\\n| hxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S | URL |\\n| hxxps://download2361.mediafire\\\\[.\\\\]com/kz5hd3dkenwgED02vBaT\\\\_kwGFdmwQ1 iAY4QGf3SAcLidcmbEn-K1HrKyPpR6ADOq7VjezmdEoNhZJFB\\\\_Wze08J1MU0iH\\\\_ oPWGS6Myj12LuXef9l7y\\\\_Em63yxedx88ezRHTt44POY858wKHjwxqr2errwIun SIHwCNMWQNQPY4\\\\_0FkZKD/wt0hho282tuxy9d/Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar | URL |\\n| sustac\\\\[.\\\\]com | Domain |\\n\\nThreat Forecast\\n---------------\\n\\nWe predict that in 2024, LummaC2 and RedLine activity will continue to grow. With the sales of credentials obtained via LummaC2 more than doubling from Q3 to Q4 2023, the stealer shows no signs of slowing down. RedLine, with its 44% rise in dark web marketplace presence in the same period and a diverse range of associated tactics for distribution and data theft, is highly probable to continue to grow. Its adaptability and affordability make it an attractive option for cybercriminals looking to harvest sensitive information efficiently.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the usage of Raccoon will likely continue to decline throughout 2024. The drastic decrease in mentions and sales of Raccoon stealer logs on cybercriminal forums toward the end of 2023 suggests threat actors\\u2019 waning interest in this tool. This downturn may result from its outdated evasion tactics, the emergence of more advanced stealers like LummaC2 and RedLine, and the arrest of a key figure behind Raccoon in late 2022. This arrest not only disrupted Raccoon\\u2019s operations but also exposed the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure, likely diminishing its appeal to cybercriminals.\\n\\nMitigations, Recommendations, and Best Practices\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile ReliaQuest Digital Risk Protection can alert customers when credentials appear in breaches or are sold on sites like Russian Market, we also take a more proactive approach. To identify the use of stealer malware, ReliaQuest offers detection rules. Implementing these rules will allow defenders to identify unauthorized software that violates policy obligations. These rules can be calibrated to each organization\\u2019s environment, to attain a higher level of fidelity and reduce false positives. In addition, we also provide containment and response plays for each detection rule. These automated plays can be executed by customers to mitigate threats if they are enabled.\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team offers the following inexhaustive list of recommendations and best practices to protect against infostealers\\u2019 impact.\\n\\n*   **Prevent saving of passwords in browsers**: Implement strict network policies or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable the saving of passwords in web browsers. This security measure is crucial as many infostealers target saved credentials in browsers to exfiltrate sensitive information. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance and effectiveness.\\n*   **Shorter session cookie timeouts**: Configure shorter session cookie timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking. By limiting the duration of sessions, even if an attacker gains access to session cookies, their window of opportunity is significantly reduced. This enhances overall security by forcing users to re-authenticate more frequently.\\n*   **Cert based authentication**: Adopt certificate-based authentication to strengthen the security of user access. Certificates provide a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords and are less susceptible to phishing attacks. Implementing this method can significantly improve the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive systems.\\n*   **Enterprise browsers**: Utilize enterprise browsers that offer enhanced security features tailored for organizational needs. These browsers often provide better management and security controls, including the ability to enforce policies, monitor usage, and protect against malicious websites. Integrating enterprise browsers can bolster security while maintaining user productivity.\\n*   **DRP for monitoring for exposed credentials**: Establish a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to continuously monitor for exposed credentials. DRP solutions can scan the dark web, paste sites, and other sources to detect if any corporate credentials have been compromised. Rapid detection allows for swift remediation actions, such as password resets and user notifications, to mitigate potential damage.\\n*   **Employee training and awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with infostealers. Training should cover the identification of phishing emails, suspicious links, and unusual requests that may be attempts to install malware. An informed workforce is a critical defense against social engineering attacks.\"}]\n",
