            "Text: In the spring of 2024, posts with real people’s personal data began appearing on the -=TWELVE=- Telegram channel. Soon it was blocked for falling foul of the Telegram terms of service. The group stayed off the radar for several months, but as we investigated a late June 2024 attack, we found that it employed techniques identical to those of Twelve and relied on C2 servers linked to the threat actor. We are therefore confident that the group is still active and will probably soon resurface. This article uses the Unified Kill Chain methodology to analyze the attackers’ actions.\n",
            "About Twelve\n",
            "The group was formed in April 2023 in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and has attacked Russian government organizations ever since.\n",
            "The threat actor specializes in encrypting and then deleting victims’ data, which seriously complicates efforts to recover the IT environment. This suggests that their main goal is inflicting as much damage as possible. When attacking, the group aims to reach critical infrastructure, but they do not always succeed. In addition, Twelve exfiltrates sensitive information from its victims’ systems and posts it on its Telegram channel.\n",
            "Interestingly, Twelve shares infrastructure, utilities and techniques (TTPs) with the DARKSTAR ransomware group, formerly known as Shadow or COMET, which suggests that the two belong to the same syndicate or activity cluster. At the same time, whereas Twelve’s actions are clearly hacktivist in nature, DARKSTAR sticks to the classic double extortion pattern. This variation of objectives within the syndicate underscores the complexity and diversity of modern cyberthreats.\n",

            "Reconnaissance\n",
            "While we do not know the exact reconnaissance techniques the threat actor uses, we suspect that they scan IP address ranges across Russia based on geotags and try to identify VPN servers and applications accessible from the internet that could be used as entry points into a target organization’s or a contractor’s infrastructure.\n",
            "Resource Development\n",
            "As we analyzed the cyberattacks, we found that the threat actor relied exclusively on well-known and freely available tools. The tools frequently used by the group include Cobalt Strike, mimikatz, chisel, BloodHound, PowerView, adPEAS, CrackMapExec, Advanced IP Scanner and PsExec.\n",
            "Initial Access and Delivery\n",
            "In most of the attacks we are aware of, the adversary gained initial access to victims’ infrastructure through valid local or domain accounts, VPN or SSH certificates. After gaining access to the victim’s infrastructure, the attackers used the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally.\n",
            "Most times, the attackers penetrated the target infrastructure via some of the victim’s contractors. To do this, they gained access to the contractor’s infrastructure and then used its certificate to connect to its customer’s VPN. Having obtained access to that, the adversary can connect to the customer’s systems via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then penetrate the customer’s infrastructure.\n",

            "Text: AUSTIN, Texas– A Ukrainian national pleaded guilty in federal court in Austin today to one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. According to court documents, Mark Sokolovsky, 28, conspired to operate the Raccoon Infostealer as a malware-as-a-service or “MaaS.” Individuals who deployed Raccoon Infostealer to steal data from victims leased access to the malware for approximately $200 per month, paid for by cryptocurrency. These individuals used various ruses, such as email phishing, to install the malware onto the computers of unsuspecting victims. Raccoon Infostealer then stole personal data from victim computers, including log-in credentials, financial information, and other personal records. Stolen information was used to commit financial crimes or was sold to others on cybercrime forums. In March 2022, concurrent with Sokolovsky’s arrest by Dutch authorities, the FBI and law enforcement partners in Italy and the Netherlands dismantled the digital infrastructure supporting the Raccoon Infostealer, taking its then existing version offline. Sokolovsky was extradited to the United States from the Netherlands in February 2024 after being indicted for crimes related to fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. As part of the plea, he agreed to a forfeiture money judgment of $23,975 and restitution of at least $910,844.61. U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas made the announcement of the defendant’s plea. The FBI’s Austin Cyber Task Force is investigating the case with the assistance of the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division (Army CID), the Austin Police Department, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the Round Rock Police Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety.

            "Text: Infostealer attacks are becoming an increasingly serious threat. Over the past few years, infostealer malware has increasingly become the weapon of choice for cybercriminals as a low-hanging fruit tactic to carry out high-impact data breaches due to their simplicity, vast availability, and low cost. The Trustwave SpiderLabs Threat Intelligence team recently discovered a new version of the SYS01 infostealer during our ongoing research of malicious activity on Facebook. With over 2.9 billion monthly active users and 200 million business accounts on Facebook, this infostealer poses a significant risk. In this campaign, hackers use malicious advertisements to steal account credentials to take over Facebook business and personal pages, as well as gain access to users' credentials, history, and cookies in web browsers. The captured information can include saved credit card info, passwords for accounts to other sites, and more. This can then lead to further rippling effects, including disruption of business operations and financial loss.  Global Director, SpiderLabs Threat Hunt Team, Trustwave.  Expanded Facebook User Targeting SYS01 represents a new wave of infostealer malware with more sophisticated capabilities and evasion techniques, making it a formidable threat. Since its emergence in March 2023, SYS01 has dramatically evolved. Initially distributed through Facebook advertisements related to adult content and gaming, this new version which has been operating since September 2023, now includes ads for AI-tools and Windows themes. This evolution advances SYS01’s appearance of legitimacy and extends its reach to target the general population, making it more challenging for users to identify and avoid malicious ads. As this malware continues to evolve and target a larger pool of potential victims, organizations should implement filtering systems to analyze ad content for signs of malware or malicious intent to help mitigate risks. It's also crucial for employees to improve their own ability to recognize spoofed ads and maintain good cybersecurity hygiene by staying informed about the latest trends and tools used by cybercriminals. The Adaptive Nature of SYS01 SYS01 can manipulate antivirus software configurations to avoid detection and maintain presence on infected systems for extended periods. This makes it much more challenging for traditional security solutions to detect the malware. With the ability to identify virtualized environments used by security researchers for malware analysis, SYS01 can further alter its behavior or halt execution to prevent discovery by security tools.   Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!   Not only can SYS01 manipulate security tools to evade detection, but its adaptability also allows it to continue to morph and adjust to increase effectiveness with each malicious ad campaign. Leveraging calculated A/B testing, SYS01 adapts and refines its ads to maximize engagement and click-through rates and repeats use of the more successful advertisements. Given the adaptive nature of SYS01, organizations should ensure they have host-based anti-malware tools to help detect and protect against malicious exploits. Security and IT teams can go a step further by keeping browsers and plugins up-to-date and configuring browsers and tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies to reduce the risk of session cookie theft of sensitive information. When prevention isn’t possible, audit controls can also help detect potential compromises. One Infostealer After Another As cybercriminals continue to innovate with their use of infostealers, maintaining vigilance and implementing robust security measures is critical. SYS01 is just one of many infostealer threats. Many of its tactics exhibit striking similarities to other infostealers, such as Rilide. Disguising itself as a legitimate Google Drive extension, Rilide targets Chromium-based browsers – such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera – leveraging Google Ads to carry out attacks that monitor browsing history and capture screenshots before injecting malicious scripts to withdraw funds from cryptocurrency exchanges. To protect against such threats, security leaders should enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across their organizations. This adds an extra layer of defense, making unauthorized access more difficult if and when users inadvertently click on malicious ads. Proactive monitoring with tools like endpoint detection and response, alongside MFA, enhances security by detecting anomalies and aggregating data across an organization’s IT infrastructure. A Call for Proactive Defense SYS01’s evolution and sophisticated capabilities underscore the growing threat posed by infostealers, particularly in its demonstrated ability to evade detection and continuously evolve. This flexibility highlights the need for cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of the curve to effectively anticipate and mitigate future threats. By investing in robust defenses, monitoring solutions, and proactive threat hunting, organizations can better safeguard against the rising risks of infostealers and protect their digital assets from potential harm.

These malicious programs often operate as part of botnets, utilizing various methods to spread and evade detection.\\n*   The ReliaQuest Threat Research team identified \\u201cLummaC2,\\u201d \\u201cRedLine,\\u201d and \\u201cRaccoon\\u201d as the most prevalent infostealers in 2023, with LummaC2 nearly doubling credential sales quarter-over-quarter. We attribute their success primarily to their unusual distribution methods.\\n*   Successful data theft by infostealers can lead to severe consequences for organizations, including financial loss, intellectual property theft, and compromised sensitive data. This stolen data can also serve as initial access for further attacks.\\n*   To combat the use of infostealers, the ReliaQuest Threat Research team recommends implementing security enhancements such as certificate-based authentication for enhanced user access security, utilizing enterprise browsers with advanced security features, and establishing a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to monitor for exposed credentials.\\n\\nInfostealer malware, which covertly infiltrates systems and harvests sensitive information, poses a significant risk to individual and organizational security. Infostealers have been a persistent threat for many years, with the earliest variant, ZeuS, emerging in 2006. Since this early example, infostealers have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Cybercriminal activity involving infostealers spiked significantly from Q3 to Q4 2023: ReliaQuest noted a 30.5% increase in cybercriminal forums marketplace listings for \\u201cstealer logs\\u201d (data harvested by infostealer malware).\\n\\nThis report provides an overview of common infostealer variants; describes their targeted geographies and sectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and outlines general mitigation steps and best practices.\\n\\nInfostealers Overview\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ever-increasing complexity and prevalence of infostealer malware is fueled by the lucrative nature of stolen data, which is commonly sold on cybercriminal forums, marketplaces, and messaging applications like Telegram. Once adversaries extract valuable information, they sometimes share stealer logs for free on these platforms; subsequent resharing on other forums allows even more threat actors to access the data at no cost.\\n\\nInfostealers are designed to infiltrate computers and transmit sensitive data, including:\\n\\n*   Usernames and passwords\\n*   Cookies\\n*   Credit card data\\n*   Cryptocurrency wallets\\n*   Browser history\\n*   Hardware/software information\\n\\nThis malware typically targets credentials from online banking websites, social media platforms, email accounts, and file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts. Modern infostealers often function as part of botnets, enabling attackers to remotely connect to an infected host and transmit data via command-and-control (C2) servers. These malicious entities spread infostealers through methods like spam email attachments, compromised websites, and malware advertising, often in conjunction with other malware types such as downloaders, Trojan droppers, and keyloggers.\\n\\nStealer malware can pose big risks with profound impacts, illustrating the critical need for heightened awareness and sophisticated defense strategies. For example, the now-notorious Change Healthcare cyber attack was initiated through compromised credentials that can be sourced from infostealer malware.\\n\\nInfostealers can disproportionately affect different sectors, geographies, and technologies. Sectors handling significant sensitive information like healthcare, finance, and retail are particularly at risk. Geographically, regions that are commonly targeted for ransomware, such as the US, UK, and Canada, seem to be most at risk. The reason behind the geographical targets is highly likely due to the higher demand in compromised credentials being purchased for these regions.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a more specific look at how threat actors can maliciously leverage stolen information:\\n\\n*   **Initial access for further attacks**: Once threat actors obtain initial access through stolen data, they can use this foothold to extract more sensitive information or to introduce other malicious software, such as ransomware, into the system.\\n*   **Credential stuffing attacks**: Threat actors may use stolen credentials to perform credential stuffing attacks on corporate accounts, exploiting the common issue of password reuse across multiple platforms.\\n*   **Bank account access**: Threat actors might attempt to access bank accounts using the stolen credentials and drain the funds or use the accounts for money laundering purposes.\\n\\nWhile infostealer malware has historically targeted individuals, the threat to corporate organizations is significant and growing. The ramifications of an infostealer malware infection for organizations are profound, encompassing not only financial loss and intellectual property theft but also severe data breaches that could impact the entire organizational structure. This malware type not only facilitates financial exploitation but also serves as a gateway for further attacks, potentially leading to widespread ransomware infections.\\n\\nMost Common Infostealers in 2023\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team has compiled an overview of the most common infostealers we observed in 2023: LummaC2, RedLine, and Raccoon.\\n\\n#### LummaC2\\n\\nLummaC2 was most prevalent infostealer in 2023, according to ReliaQuest\\u2019s collection of dark web marketplace listings. In addition, the number of LummaC2-obtained logs listed for sale increased by 110% from Q3 to Q4 2023. LummaC2\\u2019s rising popularity among adversaries is likely due to its high success rate, which refers to its effectiveness in successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data without detection. Additionally, its intuitive user interface (UI) makes the tool accessible to threat actors across a wide spectrum of skill levels.\\n\\nThe pricing model for a LummaC2 subscription ranges from $250 to $1,000 per month, depending on the subscription tier selected.\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 1: LummaC2 subscription service and description_\\n\\nLummaC2 is best known for using unconventional distribution tactics, including the deployment of trojanized software files and spearphishing emails equipped with deceptive links or attachments. This method allows LummaC2 to bypass some standard security measures designed to catch more common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads.\\n\\nFurthermore, LummaC2 targets a comprehensive array of sensitive data not limited to traditional credentials. It focuses on cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and two-factor authentication (2FA) details. This targeted approach makes LummaC2 particularly perilous for businesses that manage digital assets or utilize extensive online financial services.\\n\\nLummaC2 sets itself apart in the landscape of infostealers through its broad targeting capabilities and systematic extraction methods. Capable of infiltrating a range of systems from Windows 7 to Windows 11 and compatible with at least ten different web browsers, LummaC2\\u2019s adaptability is unmatched. Its ability to target and exfiltrate data from applications related to cryptocurrency and extensions further distinguishes it as a significant threat, especially given the rising prominence of digital currencies in business operations.\\n\\nThe stealthy nature of LummaC2\\u2019s operations makes it particularly dangerous, as it can siphon sensitive information without immediate detection, multiplying the potential damage.\\n\\n#### Redline\\n\\nRedLine ranked as the second most prevalent infostealer ReliaQuest identified in 2023, with a 44% rise in listings from Q3 to Q4 2023. This growth is noteworthy, yet it falls far short of LummaC2\\u2019s growth rate. The popularity of RedLine can likely be attributed to its high success rate of exfiltrating financial data such as cryptocurrency wallets. While not as prolific as LummaC2, RedLine has made a name for itself in the cybercriminal world due to its high infection rate and more affordable malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription starting at $100 per month, as compared to competitors, most of which start at $250.\\n\\nSince its inception in March 2020, RedLine has been utilized by initial access brokers and other malicious actors on Russian-language cybercriminal forums. It specializes in exfiltrating passwords, credit card details, instant messages, and cryptocurrency wallet information. Over time, RedLine\\u2019s distribution methods have evolved from phishing emails themed around COVID-19 to using adware through malicious Google ads, weaponizing Microsoft Office documents, and targeting digital artists in the NFT space. More recently, it has adapted by masquerading as a Windows 11 upgrade tool, demonstrating its ability to exploit current trends to enhance its dissemination.\\n\\nRedLine\\u2019s extensive technical capabilities enable it to perform a variety of malicious activities that are particularly disruptive to organizations. RedLine allows adversaries to harvest system information such as browser types, FTP client details, and hardware configurations. It can perform a range of malicious activities, including uploading and downloading files, executing commands, and relaying information about compromised systems back to the attackers. Such functionalities not only allow for the theft of sensitive data but also potentially facilitate deeper network penetration and lateral movement within a corporate environment, leading to more extensive breaches and data compromise.\\n\\nRedLine differentiates itself from other prominent infostealers like LummaC2 and Raccoon through its targeting strategy and distribution techniques. RedLine has a broader target spectrum and uses more varied distribution methods. Compared to Raccoon, which also operates on a MaaS model, RedLine\\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to current trends and its lower entry price point make it accessible and dangerous.\\n\\n#### Raccoon\\n\\nReliaQuest identified Raccoon Stealer, sometimes rendered as \\u201cRacoon,\\u201d as the third most common information stealer in 2023. Despite its ranking, mentions of Raccoon on the dark web saw a drastic decrease from Q3 to Q4 2023, largely due to the arrest of Mark Sokolovsky, a pivotal figure behind Raccoon, in late 2022. This arrest disrupted operations temporarily and led to significant law enforcement scrutiny, which temporarily halted Raccoon\\u2019s activities.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is adept at stealing a wide range of data from over 60 different applications, including sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, browsing history, and cryptocurrency wallet data. In August 2023, the developers released an updated version based on user feedback and market trends. This version introduced features like an innovative URL search method for quick data access, automatic bot detection and blocking, and detailed log statistics.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer\\u2019s subscription was initially priced at $200 per month but increased to $275 in August 2023. It is also offered at $125 per week, making it accessible for short-term use.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is differentiated by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, catering to less technically skilled cybercriminals. Raccoon focuses on providing a simple yet effective tool for extensive data harvesting, making it particularly dangerous for organizations. The stealer\\u2019s ability to target a vast range of applications and its enhancements aimed at evading detection make it a formidable tool for extracting corporate data.\\n\\nThe resilience and adaptability of Raccoon Stealer, despite significant disruptions such as the arrest of its key developer, highlight the persistent threat posed by such cybercriminal tools. Organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts to defend against such sophisticated malware.\\n\\n#### LummaC2 Case Study\\n\\nIn October 2023, ReliaQuest observed in a customer environment the execution of the unauthorized file \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar,\\u201d which is associated with LummaC2. Shortly before the malicious file was downloaded, the user attempted to install a cracked license key from the license key download service \\u201chdlicense\\\\[.\\\\]com.\\u201d This redirected the user to \\u201chxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S,\\u201d where the user was prompted to download the malicious RAR file. After clicking the download prompt, the user was redirected to multiple domains, including \\u201csustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\u201d and a free file-hosting server that initiated the LummaC2 malware download.\\n\\n\\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d contained multiple files, including a legitimate, signed copy of the cross-platform media player \\u201cVLC Player\\u201d renamed as \\u201cSetup.exe\\u201d and the LummaC2 executable. The executable used a technique called Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading to import a copy of the VLC Player library (\\u201clibvlc.dll\\u201d), which then imported a malicious version of the library (\\u201clibvlccore.dll\\u201d). libvlccore.dll loaded the LummaC2 payload. Using DLL side-loading enabled the adversary to bypass security measures, execute the malware, and establish a C2 connection to \\u201chxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api.\\u201d\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers1.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 2: Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar file contents_\\n\\nIn this case study, ReliaQuest communicated to the impacted organization our recommendation to first isolate the impacted endpoint to disable any communication or active connections. We then deleted the \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d file and blocked all associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). The impacted organization rotated the user\\u2019s credentials, reimaged the endpoint, and notified the user of the organization\\u2019s acceptable use policy (AUP). Further communication with the impacted customer confirmed that no additional IOCs or C2 traffic were identified following these steps.\\n\\nThis incident showcases characteristic hallmarks of LummaC2, including the use of legitimate software to disguise malware activities and the exploitation of less secure third-party download sites. To prevent similar incidents, organizations should implement stringent controls on software downloads and installations, which in this case allowed the initial download of a cracked software key.\\n\\nBelow is a list of IoCs we observed in this case study:\\n\\n**IOC**\\n\\n**Type**\\n\\n7a35008a1a1ae3d093703c3a34a21993409af42eb61161aad1b6ae4afa8bbb70\\n\\nHash\\n\\na9e9d7770ff948bb65c0db24431f75dd934a803181afa22b6b014fac9a162dab\\n\\nHash\\n\\nhxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://download2361.mediafire\\\\[.\\\\]com/kz5hd3dkenwgED02vBaT\\\\_kwGFdmwQ1 iAY4QGf3SAcLidcmbEn-K1HrKyPpR6ADOq7VjezmdEoNhZJFB\\\\_Wze08J1MU0iH\\\\_ oPWGS6Myj12LuXef9l7y\\\\_Em63yxedx88ezRHTt44POY858wKHjwxqr2errwIun SIHwCNMWQNQPY4\\\\_0FkZKD/wt0hho282tuxy9d/Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\n\\nURL\\n\\nsustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\n\\nDomain\\n\\nThreat Forecast\\n---------------\\n\\nWe predict that in 2024, LummaC2 and RedLine activity will continue to grow. With the sales of credentials obtained via LummaC2 more than doubling from Q3 to Q4 2023, the stealer shows no signs of slowing down. RedLine, with its 44% rise in dark web marketplace presence in the same period and a diverse range of associated tactics for distribution and data theft, is highly probable to continue to grow. Its adaptability and affordability make it an attractive option for cybercriminals looking to harvest sensitive information efficiently.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the usage of Raccoon will likely continue to decline throughout 2024. The drastic decrease in mentions and sales of Raccoon stealer logs on cybercriminal forums toward the end of 2023 suggests threat actors\\u2019 waning interest in this tool. This downturn may result from its outdated evasion tactics, the emergence of more advanced stealers like LummaC2 and RedLine, and the arrest of a key figure behind Raccoon in late 2022. This arrest not only disrupted Raccoon\\u2019s operations but also exposed the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure, likely diminishing its appeal to cybercriminals.\\n\\nMitigations, Recommendations, and Best Practices\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile ReliaQuest Digital Risk Protection can alert customers when credentials appear in breaches or are sold on sites like Russian Market, we also take a more proactive approach. To identify the use of stealer malware, ReliaQuest offers detection rules. Implementing these rules will allow defenders to identify unauthorized software that violates policy obligations. These rules can be calibrated to each organization\\u2019s environment, to attain a higher level of fidelity and reduce false positives. In addition, we also provide containment and response plays for each detection rule. These automated plays can be executed by customers to mitigate threats if they are enabled.\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team offers the following inexhaustive list of recommendations and best practices to protect against infostealers\\u2019 impact.\\n\\n*   **Prevent saving of passwords in browsers**: Implement strict network policies or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable the saving of passwords in web browsers. This security measure is crucial as many infostealers target saved credentials in browsers to exfiltrate sensitive information. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance and effectiveness.\\n*   **Shorter session cookie timeouts**: Configure shorter session cookie timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking. By limiting the duration of sessions, even if an attacker gains access to session cookies, their window of opportunity is significantly reduced. This enhances overall security by forcing users to re-authenticate more frequently.\\n*   **Cert based authentication**: Adopt certificate-based authentication to strengthen the security of user access. Certificates provide a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords and are less susceptible to phishing attacks. Implementing this method can significantly improve the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive systems.\\n*   **Enterprise browsers**: Utilize enterprise browsers that offer enhanced security features tailored for organizational needs. These browsers often provide better management and security controls, including the ability to enforce policies, monitor usage, and protect against malicious websites. Integrating enterprise browsers can bolster security while maintaining user productivity.\\n*   **DRP for monitoring for exposed credentials**: Establish a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to continuously monitor for exposed credentials. DRP solutions can scan the dark web, paste sites, and other sources to detect if any corporate credentials have been compromised. Rapid detection allows for swift remediation actions, such as password resets and user notifications, to mitigate potential damage.\\n*   **Employee training and awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with infostealers. Training should cover the identification of phishing emails, suspicious links, and unusual requests that may be attempts to install malware. An informed workforce is a critical defense against social engineering attacks.\"}, {\"title\": \"RedLine Stealer: IoC Analysis and Expansion\", \"link\": \"https://circleid.com/posts/20230104-redline-stealer-ioc-analysis-and-expansion\", \"snippet\": \"For roughly US$100, threat actors can purchase RedLine Stealer, a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) program first detected in March 2020 that continues to wreak havoc to this day.

[The Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), developed by Lockheed Martin, details the sequential phases of a cyber attack: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. Attacker tactics and techniques can be mapped using models such as the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.\\n\\nFollowing these known strategies, after gaining unauthorized initial access, the installation phase allows the attacker to establish a foothold, and through command and control (C2), they maintain ongoing access to the compromised environment.\\n\\nDuring these middle stages InfoStealer malware often comes into play. InfoStealer malware is a type of malicious software specifically designed to extract sensitive information from an infected system. The stolen information can be leveraged to extort victims, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid, or sold on the blackmarket to other organized criminal organizations.\\u00a0 Furthermore, if the stolen information contains the victim's credentials such as username, passwords, or private keys, the attacker can use them to compromise other systems, furthering their attack.\\n\\nIn this article we will provide a comprehensive review of InfoStealer malware, what information it targets, how it operates, and list the most prolific InfoStealer malware strains. By understanding the role of InfoStealer malware organizations can better prepare and respond to the intricate landscape of cyber threats they face today.\\n\\nWhat is InfoStealer Malware?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware, as its name suggests, is a type of malicious software designed specifically to gather sensitive information from infected systems. This category of malware targets personal, financial, and business data, which can include passwords, [credit card numbers](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/pci-penetration-test/), browsing history, and other valuable information. The ultimate goal of InfoStealers is to transmit this stolen data to cybercriminals who can use it for financial gain, identity theft, or further malicious activities.\\n\\nInfoStealers often enter systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or [compromised websites](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/heres-how-you-can-defend-against-drive-by-compromise-attacks/). Once installed, they can operate quietly in the background, making them particularly hard to detect. They may also employ various techniques to avoid detection, maintain persistence, find other valuable targets on a network, and allow attackers to issue commands remotely. The most sophisticated InfoStealers are modular; they can import specific payloads after scanning the environment for potential sources of valuable information.\\n\\nHow Do InfoStealers Work?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware employs a variety of techniques to target and extract specific types of data from infected systems. Each strain of malware that is classified as a InfoStealer has different capabilities ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated modular malware. It's also important to remember that data can be stolen from a system using native built-in OS tooling known as a [Living Off The Land (LOTL)](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-living-off-the-land-attacks/) attack.\\n\\nEach method discussed below targets specific types of data or input-output peripherals. Each method also leverages unique vulnerabilities associated with how that data is used, stored, and transmitted. The diversity of these techniques underscores the necessity for comprehensive security measures that protect not just against one type of threat but a broad array of infiltration strategies.\\n\\nHere are some ways that InfoStealer malware operates:\\n\\n*   **Keylogging**: One of the most common tactics, keylogging involves recording keystrokes made by a user. By capturing everything typed, attackers can later filter out passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive personal information\\n    \\n*   **Form Grabbing**: This technique is used to intercept data submitted in forms on web pages before it is encrypted by the browser. It's particularly effective for stealing login credentials, payment information, and other data entered on websites\\n    \\n*   **Clipboard Hijacking**: InfoStealers can monitor and modify the clipboard content on an infected device. When a user copies data such as account numbers or passwords, the malware replaces or steals this information. This attack technique can even steal usernames and passwords as they are auto-filled by a [password manager](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/password-manager-breach/)\\n    \\n*   **Screen Capturing**: By taking screenshots of the user\\u2019s screen at critical moments\\u2014such as while entering credentials or viewing personal information\\u2014this method can bypass text-based data extraction limitations, capturing data displayed on the screen in any form\\n    \\n*   **Browser Session Hijacking**: This method involves stealing cookies and session tokens from a browser's cached memory which can allow cybercriminals to impersonate the victim's online session, gaining unauthorized access to online accounts without needing a username and password\\n    \\n*   **Credential Dumping**: This method extracts data from user accounts stored on the system, such as login credentials saved in web browsers or other client software. If they are stored in encrypted format, attackers will attempt to crack them offline using specialized hardware and software tools\\n    \\n*   **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: These are more sophisticated attacks where the malware injects malicious code [into the web browser itself](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/how-safe-are-your-browsers/). This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate information in real-time as it is entered on secure websites\\n    \\n*   **Email Harvesting**: The malware searches through files and emails stored on the computer to collect email addresses and other contact information, which can be used for spamming or further phishing attacks\\n    \\n*   **Crypto-Wallet Harvesting:** Some InfoStealer malware can search known installation paths for common crypto-wallet software and attempt to steal private keys. Once in the attacker's possession these keys can be used to transfer the victim's cryptocurrency to attacker controlled accounts\\n    \\n\\nThe Most Prolific Strains of InfoStealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstimating the exact number of InfoStealer malware strains is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of malware and the frequent emergence of new variants. However, cybersecurity experts and researchers generally agree that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different strains of InfoStealer malware in existence.

Ducktail malware is typically delivered through a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. Once the malware infects a system, it establishes a persistent presence and begins to gather information about the system and the network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis info-stealer is being disseminated through Facebook URLs, employing a technique that redirects users to suspicious websites or pages. Once redirected, users are prompted to manually click on a download button, which initiates the download of malicious files onto their devices. This method of distribution capitalizes on user interaction and engagement to deceive them into downloading the malware. The malicious files obtained through this process pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of the affected users, potentially leading to various harmful consequences such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, system compromise, or further malware infections.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://cdn-igifd.nitrocdn.com/LjFqjuxPeeUzGqzhGkddQHQrbKmisRar/assets/images/optimized/rev-c5d0e80/www.rewterz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/an-emerging-ducktail-infostealer.png)\\n\\nThe research team has been analyzing a series of info-stealing malware, and they have recently come across an interesting campaign involving the PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer. This malware is being actively distributed by disguising itself as a free or cracked application installer for popular software, including games, Microsoft Office applications, and Telegram. Ducktail Infostealer, attributed to a Vietnamese threat group, has been active since 2021 and has primarily targeted Facebook Business accounts to manipulate pages and gain access to financial information.\\n\\nThe Ducktail Infostealer instances were first identified in late 2021. In July 2022, researchers observed that the threat actors were specifically targeting higher-level employees with access to Facebook Business accounts to steal data and take control of the accounts. The earlier versions of Ducktail were based on a binary written in .NET Core and utilized Telegram as its command and control (C2) channel for exfiltrating data. However, in August 2022, a new campaign was observed involving a PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer with new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\\n\\nAccording to an analysis, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting specific employees with administrative or financial access to Facebook Business accounts to a broader audience. The malicious executable files are typically in .ZIP format and are hosted on file-sharing platforms, posing as cracked or free versions of popular applications like Office, games, subtitles, and explicit content files. Compared to previous campaigns, changes have been made in the execution of the malicious code. The threat actors now employ a scripting version where the main stealer code is a PHP script instead of a .NET binary.\\n\\nThe execution flow begins with a fake installer that generates a temporary file, which then re-initiates the installer with a \\\"/Silent\\\" parameter. Another temporary file is created, which drops all the supporting files and malicious files at a specific location on the victim's machine. To achieve persistence, a series of events take place, scheduling tasks to execute the malicious payload, named \\\"libbridged.exe,\\\" daily and at regular intervals.\\n\\nThe stealing of data and its exfiltration are achieved by decrypting the stealer code at runtime in memory. The PHP script performs various actions, such as fetching browser information, extracting stored browser cookies, targeting Facebook Business accounts, searching for cryptocurrency account information in the wallet.dat file, and sending the collected data to the command and control (C&C) server.\\n\\nThe PHP script creates PHP associative arrays to prepare for data transmission to the C&C server. The CURL command is used for sending and receiving files over HTTP, and specific switches are employed during communication.\\n\\nThe script also collects information about installed browsers, retrieves data from the local state file in the Chrome user data directory, decodes sensitive data protected by Chrome's local data encryption, encodes stolen information to base64, and saves it to log files. It specifically targets Facebook pages, including Facebook API graph, Facebook Ads Manager, and Facebook Business accounts, to gather account details, payment cycles, account statuses, funding sources, and other relevant information.\\n\\nAfter completing the data-stealing activities, the PHP script connects to the C&C server to obtain a list of targeted folders and URLs stored in JSON format, which are then used to gather further information. The stolen data is sent to the C&C server in JSON format.\\n\\nTo conclude, the threat actors behind the Ducktail Infostealer campaign are continuously evolving their delivery mechanisms and tactics to steal a wide range of sensitive user and system information, particularly targeting Facebook Business accounts.\\n\\nImpact\\n------\\n\\n*   Sensitive Information Theft\\n*   Credential Theft\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise\\n------------------------\\n\\n#### Domain Name\\n\\n*   bwtraining.nl\\n*   dj-w.nl\\n*   ductri.shop\\n*   evdgoudsmid.nl\\n*   fsh-kpn.nl\\n*   funatfunction.nl\\n*   hakotrailers.nl\\n*   laterremadit.fr\\n*   lwdzuid.nl\\n*   nano-phone.fr\\n*   sgf-advies.nl\\n*   singano.shop\\n*   thediverse.se\\n*   zaoui.nl\\n*   dfgdfgfdgdfgdfg.shop\\n*   dausoviettelpro.online\\n*   insiktnordahl.se\\n\\n#### MD5\\n\\n*   de8d2f3a429b72be0b3fa968e89554c1\\n*   aa424dafb152c8696d472c001463b498\\n*   42df34c8cddcb2ebf793869d4220cc2b\\n*   b5fb2e07d7f0353c9648976d0cd2d9de\\n*   0f548b327788e6352eb262a138c1f87b\\n*   019c5102755e3f50e4d44ca82c9626ef\\n*   c1d0c76c34e1eb3588b05547dede3529\\n*   30e9e32a73933af3083b584af7858a3a\\n*   5cfc95d5f595963bb00c3d6ad96949e9\\n*   424ea05ac23ba6a504c1b193b6c5bcaf\\n*   512be004172b5715d881e0551d99590a\\n*   cff1b30dabdb292a22fa38c65df0bd40\\n*   5ec0d1215f205e9b4e8cd8d8f4095987\\n*   0f47b858719fbd7def7fd7f42b228cc0\\n*   d0b361bab520a5c1ee7c33aa1321100f\\n\\n#### SHA-256\\n\\n*   90523861a28cf8a33cfb2681fcbf029a16d353aea24d7fc47850af420e68835c\\n*   26dcfbc7cb948a84d5a24df6ebe9641a2a6201512aef5def698418a8e25e1fb0\\n*   c84c2d3be279f5eea89b6a40989a7511896c826b62341707971370f817e9b1c9\\n*   1b7d6e68479b6779b3992775faad0224beb3cc572c974b48ab184fec96012693\\n*   2187eab7da2eda3425f76ef8a051d83706304da3457a0188573a0a8d67fbc82b\\n*   5c7296ee878788c0fed596cac75498f11e218fa783fd1f4c92df8994f52049cc\\n*   73d7739688d8ae59c95cb14ea212ab5eedcd10e22cbed323cfbb072de139bc42\\n*   bab2ce1025546d4f5e988c85328d22ed7182dec9e741bcf2010ae0ff7ac5a031\\n*   8b9706472cbac5ddc24bd904b796d2fca6ba0729278ea6a1304815828db57da7\\n*   217bb8f973660942a6272a38702579f32e92f9f14b1f3287900fadb1dd28a542\\n*   0cebcb2df28653ec969bb2961abc2b74e666829f620a53705dcfad8d2c6362b6\\n*   10f158890c91e819b5a80ac17ae3bb96e98fe3a0c2dd97efac0c92b70ac00604\\n*   4c7b635e100b52c3a1ae92630b1933ab51baea8dea2646015b52ac4495887ce4\\n*   4ea385d2ecf3b53ad909c69a05e2906ca5e91be55eb5e12286fa516b516b8889\\n*   663221ff71dc932f91d4a9f6ecbb77cd1afc8d93f77a1e7e4f7d1fc3280dee93\\n\\n#### SHA-1\\n\\n*   86285bb8af48913b041374df15cceeaabb853498\\n*   8e1d5da5924df66077495191c8d5a3b6e1252eb3\\n*   a564a1d75214f10d1d9ef9cab0eb32d7db3008c0\\n*   29d40663e3222ef728cca4d838729325a5a81d5a\\n*   fbd3fecf461ec1de949bdd81a7695e1a11fa37e6\\n*   446e4a72f692bd48407ca073957df7dbbc86764c\\n*   66d7224339e16c08947e8ff7f8ea98b0197977a5\\n*   5d4d4ebcd6a6c7a3194fdd1d7f12ea1fa659bbb8\\n*   7372273c7f1d0417eb3c003395e7f6ddad8c39b0\\n*   5ca4cc70b71208bc3edef432edd01540874054e7\\n*   faaf431589e8121b2af3fa6b8fcffb2286055c9a\\n*   7e20c34516060af5468959edf848e26c1e1747bc\\n*   fa13cfffbfe4303114daa91686a08cb37c908157\\n*   51ea1ac2f86993ebd8b11df5417feaca8a42f55d\\n*   622b8eef1a0491d8e2f57d0c24c9fdd003510c60\\n\\nRemediation\\n-----------\\n\\n*   Block all threat indicators at your respective controls.

Infostealers have been a persistent threat for many years, with the earliest variant, ZeuS, emerging in 2006. Since this early example, infostealers have become increasingly sophisticated and widespread. Cybercriminal activity involving infostealers spiked significantly from Q3 to Q4 2023: ReliaQuest noted a 30.5% increase in cybercriminal forums marketplace listings for \\u201cstealer logs\\u201d (data harvested by infostealer malware).\\n\\nThis report provides an overview of common infostealer variants; describes their targeted geographies and sectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and outlines general mitigation steps and best practices.\\n\\nInfostealers Overview\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ever-increasing complexity and prevalence of infostealer malware is fueled by the lucrative nature of stolen data, which is commonly sold on cybercriminal forums, marketplaces, and messaging applications like Telegram. Once adversaries extract valuable information, they sometimes share stealer logs for free on these platforms; subsequent resharing on other forums allows even more threat actors to access the data at no cost.\\n\\nInfostealers are designed to infiltrate computers and transmit sensitive data, including:\\n\\n*   Usernames and passwords\\n*   Cookies\\n*   Credit card data\\n*   Cryptocurrency wallets\\n*   Browser history\\n*   Hardware/software information\\n\\nThis malware typically targets credentials from online banking websites, social media platforms, email accounts, and file transfer protocol (FTP) accounts. Modern infostealers often function as part of botnets, enabling attackers to remotely connect to an infected host and transmit data via command-and-control (C2) servers. These malicious entities spread infostealers through methods like spam email attachments, compromised websites, and malware advertising, often in conjunction with other malware types such as downloaders, Trojan droppers, and keyloggers.\\n\\nStealer malware can pose big risks with profound impacts, illustrating the critical need for heightened awareness and sophisticated defense strategies. For example, the now-notorious Change Healthcare cyber attack was initiated through compromised credentials that can be sourced from infostealer malware.\\n\\nInfostealers can disproportionately affect different sectors, geographies, and technologies. Sectors handling significant sensitive information like healthcare, finance, and retail are particularly at risk. Geographically, regions that are commonly targeted for ransomware, such as the US, UK, and Canada, seem to be most at risk. The reason behind the geographical targets is highly likely due to the higher demand in compromised credentials being purchased for these regions.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a more specific look at how threat actors can maliciously leverage stolen information:\\n\\n*   **Initial access for further attacks**: Once threat actors obtain initial access through stolen data, they can use this foothold to extract more sensitive information or to introduce other malicious software, such as ransomware, into the system.\\n*   **Credential stuffing attacks**: Threat actors may use stolen credentials to perform credential stuffing attacks on corporate accounts, exploiting the common issue of password reuse across multiple platforms.\\n*   **Bank account access**: Threat actors might attempt to access bank accounts using the stolen credentials and drain the funds or use the accounts for money laundering purposes.\\n\\nWhile infostealer malware has historically targeted individuals, the threat to corporate organizations is significant and growing. The ramifications of an infostealer malware infection for organizations are profound, encompassing not only financial loss and intellectual property theft but also severe data breaches that could impact the entire organizational structure. This malware type not only facilitates financial exploitation but also serves as a gateway for further attacks, potentially leading to widespread ransomware infections.\\n\\nMost Common Infostealers in 2023\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team has compiled an overview of the most common infostealers we observed in 2023: LummaC2, RedLine, and Raccoon.\\n\\n#### LummaC2\\n\\nLummaC2 was most prevalent infostealer in 2023, according to ReliaQuest\\u2019s collection of dark web marketplace listings. In addition, the number of LummaC2-obtained logs listed for sale increased by 110% from Q3 to Q4 2023. LummaC2\\u2019s rising popularity among adversaries is likely due to its high success rate, which refers to its effectiveness in successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data without detection. Additionally, its intuitive user interface (UI) makes the tool accessible to threat actors across a wide spectrum of skill levels.\\n\\nThe pricing model for a LummaC2 subscription ranges from $250 to $1,000 per month, depending on the subscription tier selected.\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 1: LummaC2 subscription service and description_\\n\\nLummaC2 is best known for using unconventional distribution tactics, including the deployment of trojanized software files and spearphishing emails equipped with deceptive links or attachments. This method allows LummaC2 to bypass some standard security measures designed to catch more common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads.\\n\\nFurthermore, LummaC2 targets a comprehensive array of sensitive data not limited to traditional credentials. It focuses on cryptocurrency wallets, browser extensions, and two-factor authentication (2FA) details. This targeted approach makes LummaC2 particularly perilous for businesses that manage digital assets or utilize extensive online financial services.\\n\\nLummaC2 sets itself apart in the landscape of infostealers through its broad targeting capabilities and systematic extraction methods. Capable of infiltrating a range of systems from Windows 7 to Windows 11 and compatible with at least ten different web browsers, LummaC2\\u2019s adaptability is unmatched. Its ability to target and exfiltrate data from applications related to cryptocurrency and extensions further distinguishes it as a significant threat, especially given the rising prominence of digital currencies in business operations.\\n\\nThe stealthy nature of LummaC2\\u2019s operations makes it particularly dangerous, as it can siphon sensitive information without immediate detection, multiplying the potential damage.\\n\\n#### Redline\\n\\nRedLine ranked as the second most prevalent infostealer ReliaQuest identified in 2023, with a 44% rise in listings from Q3 to Q4 2023. This growth is noteworthy, yet it falls far short of LummaC2\\u2019s growth rate. The popularity of RedLine can likely be attributed to its high success rate of exfiltrating financial data such as cryptocurrency wallets. While not as prolific as LummaC2, RedLine has made a name for itself in the cybercriminal world due to its high infection rate and more affordable malware-as-a-service (MaaS) subscription starting at $100 per month, as compared to competitors, most of which start at $250.\\n\\nSince its inception in March 2020, RedLine has been utilized by initial access brokers and other malicious actors on Russian-language cybercriminal forums. It specializes in exfiltrating passwords, credit card details, instant messages, and cryptocurrency wallet information. Over time, RedLine\\u2019s distribution methods have evolved from phishing emails themed around COVID-19 to using adware through malicious Google ads, weaponizing Microsoft Office documents, and targeting digital artists in the NFT space. More recently, it has adapted by masquerading as a Windows 11 upgrade tool, demonstrating its ability to exploit current trends to enhance its dissemination.\\n\\nRedLine\\u2019s extensive technical capabilities enable it to perform a variety of malicious activities that are particularly disruptive to organizations. RedLine allows adversaries to harvest system information such as browser types, FTP client details, and hardware configurations. It can perform a range of malicious activities, including uploading and downloading files, executing commands, and relaying information about compromised systems back to the attackers. Such functionalities not only allow for the theft of sensitive data but also potentially facilitate deeper network penetration and lateral movement within a corporate environment, leading to more extensive breaches and data compromise.\\n\\nRedLine differentiates itself from other prominent infostealers like LummaC2 and Raccoon through its targeting strategy and distribution techniques. RedLine has a broader target spectrum and uses more varied distribution methods. Compared to Raccoon, which also operates on a MaaS model, RedLine\\u2019s ability to adapt quickly to current trends and its lower entry price point make it accessible and dangerous.\\n\\n#### Raccoon\\n\\nReliaQuest identified Raccoon Stealer, sometimes rendered as \\u201cRacoon,\\u201d as the third most common information stealer in 2023. Despite its ranking, mentions of Raccoon on the dark web saw a drastic decrease from Q3 to Q4 2023, largely due to the arrest of Mark Sokolovsky, a pivotal figure behind Raccoon, in late 2022. This arrest disrupted operations temporarily and led to significant law enforcement scrutiny, which temporarily halted Raccoon\\u2019s activities.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is adept at stealing a wide range of data from over 60 different applications, including sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, browsing history, and cryptocurrency wallet data. In August 2023, the developers released an updated version based on user feedback and market trends. This version introduced features like an innovative URL search method for quick data access, automatic bot detection and blocking, and detailed log statistics.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer\\u2019s subscription was initially priced at $200 per month but increased to $275 in August 2023. It is also offered at $125 per week, making it accessible for short-term use.\\n\\nRaccoon Stealer is differentiated by its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, catering to less technically skilled cybercriminals. Raccoon focuses on providing a simple yet effective tool for extensive data harvesting, making it particularly dangerous for organizations. The stealer\\u2019s ability to target a vast range of applications and its enhancements aimed at evading detection make it a formidable tool for extracting corporate data.\\n\\nThe resilience and adaptability of Raccoon Stealer, despite significant disruptions such as the arrest of its key developer, highlight the persistent threat posed by such cybercriminal tools. Organizations must remain vigilant and proactive in their cybersecurity efforts to defend against such sophisticated malware.\\n\\n#### LummaC2 Case Study\\n\\nIn October 2023, ReliaQuest observed in a customer environment the execution of the unauthorized file \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar,\\u201d which is associated with LummaC2. Shortly before the malicious file was downloaded, the user attempted to install a cracked license key from the license key download service \\u201chdlicense\\\\[.\\\\]com.\\u201d This redirected the user to \\u201chxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S,\\u201d where the user was prompted to download the malicious RAR file. After clicking the download prompt, the user was redirected to multiple domains, including \\u201csustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\u201d and a free file-hosting server that initiated the LummaC2 malware download.\\n\\n\\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d contained multiple files, including a legitimate, signed copy of the cross-platform media player \\u201cVLC Player\\u201d renamed as \\u201cSetup.exe\\u201d and the LummaC2 executable. The executable used a technique called Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading to import a copy of the VLC Player library (\\u201clibvlc.dll\\u201d), which then imported a malicious version of the library (\\u201clibvlccore.dll\\u201d). libvlccore.dll loaded the LummaC2 payload. Using DLL side-loading enabled the adversary to bypass security measures, execute the malware, and establish a C2 connection to \\u201chxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api.\\u201d\\n\\n![](https://www.reliaquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/infostealers1.svg)\\n\\n_Figure 2: Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar file contents_\\n\\nIn this case study, ReliaQuest communicated to the impacted organization our recommendation to first isolate the impacted endpoint to disable any communication or active connections. We then deleted the \\u201cPasswrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\u201d file and blocked all associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). The impacted organization rotated the user\\u2019s credentials, reimaged the endpoint, and notified the user of the organization\\u2019s acceptable use policy (AUP). Further communication with the impacted customer confirmed that no additional IOCs or C2 traffic were identified following these steps.\\n\\nThis incident showcases characteristic hallmarks of LummaC2, including the use of legitimate software to disguise malware activities and the exploitation of less secure third-party download sites. To prevent similar incidents, organizations should implement stringent controls on software downloads and installations, which in this case allowed the initial download of a cracked software key.\\n\\nBelow is a list of IoCs we observed in this case study:\\n\\n**IOC**\\n\\n**Type**\\n\\n7a35008a1a1ae3d093703c3a34a21993409af42eb61161aad1b6ae4afa8bbb70\\n\\nHash\\n\\na9e9d7770ff948bb65c0db24431f75dd934a803181afa22b6b014fac9a162dab\\n\\nHash\\n\\nhxxp://ebalkayiu\\\\[.\\\\]fun/api\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://1july\\\\[.\\\\]com/rMKNqt3S\\n\\nURL\\n\\nhxxps://download2361.mediafire\\\\[.\\\\]com/kz5hd3dkenwgED02vBaT\\\\_kwGFdmwQ1 iAY4QGf3SAcLidcmbEn-K1HrKyPpR6ADOq7VjezmdEoNhZJFB\\\\_Wze08J1MU0iH\\\\_ oPWGS6Myj12LuXef9l7y\\\\_Em63yxedx88ezRHTt44POY858wKHjwxqr2errwIun SIHwCNMWQNQPY4\\\\_0FkZKD/wt0hho282tuxy9d/Passwrd-2023\\\\_Setup.rar\\n\\nURL\\n\\nsustac\\\\[.\\\\]com\\n\\nDomain\\n\\nThreat Forecast\\n---------------\\n\\nWe predict that in 2024, LummaC2 and RedLine activity will continue to grow. With the sales of credentials obtained via LummaC2 more than doubling from Q3 to Q4 2023, the stealer shows no signs of slowing down. RedLine, with its 44% rise in dark web marketplace presence in the same period and a diverse range of associated tactics for distribution and data theft, is highly probable to continue to grow. Its adaptability and affordability make it an attractive option for cybercriminals looking to harvest sensitive information efficiently.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the usage of Raccoon will likely continue to decline throughout 2024. The drastic decrease in mentions and sales of Raccoon stealer logs on cybercriminal forums toward the end of 2023 suggests threat actors\\u2019 waning interest in this tool. This downturn may result from its outdated evasion tactics, the emergence of more advanced stealers like LummaC2 and RedLine, and the arrest of a key figure behind Raccoon in late 2022. This arrest not only disrupted Raccoon\\u2019s operations but also exposed the vulnerabilities within its infrastructure, likely diminishing its appeal to cybercriminals.\\n\\nMitigations, Recommendations, and Best Practices\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhile ReliaQuest Digital Risk Protection can alert customers when credentials appear in breaches or are sold on sites like Russian Market, we also take a more proactive approach. To identify the use of stealer malware, ReliaQuest offers detection rules. Implementing these rules will allow defenders to identify unauthorized software that violates policy obligations. These rules can be calibrated to each organization\\u2019s environment, to attain a higher level of fidelity and reduce false positives. In addition, we also provide containment and response plays for each detection rule. These automated plays can be executed by customers to mitigate threats if they are enabled.\\n\\nThe ReliaQuest Threat Research team offers the following inexhaustive list of recommendations and best practices to protect against infostealers\\u2019 impact.\\n\\n*   **Prevent saving of passwords in browsers**: Implement strict network policies or Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable the saving of passwords in web browsers. This security measure is crucial as many infostealers target saved credentials in browsers to exfiltrate sensitive information. Regular audits should be conducted to ensure compliance and effectiveness.\\n*   **Shorter session cookie timeouts**: Configure shorter session cookie timeouts to reduce the risk of session hijacking. By limiting the duration of sessions, even if an attacker gains access to session cookies, their window of opportunity is significantly reduced. This enhances overall security by forcing users to re-authenticate more frequently.\\n*   **Cert based authentication**: Adopt certificate-based authentication to strengthen the security of user access. Certificates provide a higher level of security compared to traditional passwords and are less susceptible to phishing attacks. Implementing this method can significantly improve the security posture by ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive systems.\\n*   **Enterprise browsers**: Utilize enterprise browsers that offer enhanced security features tailored for organizational needs. These browsers often provide better management and security controls, including the ability to enforce policies, monitor usage, and protect against malicious websites. Integrating enterprise browsers can bolster security while maintaining user productivity.\\n*   **DRP for monitoring for exposed credentials**: Establish a Digital Risk Protection (DRP) strategy to continuously monitor for exposed credentials. DRP solutions can scan the dark web, paste sites, and other sources to detect if any corporate credentials have been compromised. Rapid detection allows for swift remediation actions, such as password resets and user notifications, to mitigate potential damage.\\n*   **Employee training and awareness**: Conduct regular training sessions to educate employees about the risks associated with infostealers. Training should cover the identification of phishing emails, suspicious links, and unusual requests that may be attempts to install malware. An informed workforce is a critical defense against social engineering attacks.\"}, {\"title\": \"RedLine Stealer: IoC Analysis and Expansion\", \"link\": \"https://circleid.com/posts/20230104-redline-stealer-ioc-analysis-and-expansion\", \"snippet\": \"For roughly US$100, threat actors can purchase RedLine Stealer, a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) program first detected in March 2020 that continues to wreak havoc to this day.

[The Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html), developed by Lockheed Martin, details the sequential phases of a cyber attack: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control (C2), and actions on objectives. Attacker tactics and techniques can be mapped using models such as the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.\\n\\nFollowing these known strategies, after gaining unauthorized initial access, the installation phase allows the attacker to establish a foothold, and through command and control (C2), they maintain ongoing access to the compromised environment.\\n\\nDuring these middle stages InfoStealer malware often comes into play. InfoStealer malware is a type of malicious software specifically designed to extract sensitive information from an infected system. The stolen information can be leveraged to extort victims, threatening to release the data unless a ransom is paid, or sold on the blackmarket to other organized criminal organizations.\\u00a0 Furthermore, if the stolen information contains the victim's credentials such as username, passwords, or private keys, the attacker can use them to compromise other systems, furthering their attack.\\n\\nIn this article we will provide a comprehensive review of InfoStealer malware, what information it targets, how it operates, and list the most prolific InfoStealer malware strains. By understanding the role of InfoStealer malware organizations can better prepare and respond to the intricate landscape of cyber threats they face today.\\n\\nWhat is InfoStealer Malware?\\n----------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware, as its name suggests, is a type of malicious software designed specifically to gather sensitive information from infected systems. This category of malware targets personal, financial, and business data, which can include passwords, [credit card numbers](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/pci-penetration-test/), browsing history, and other valuable information. The ultimate goal of InfoStealers is to transmit this stolen data to cybercriminals who can use it for financial gain, identity theft, or further malicious activities.\\n\\nInfoStealers often enter systems through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or [compromised websites](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/heres-how-you-can-defend-against-drive-by-compromise-attacks/). Once installed, they can operate quietly in the background, making them particularly hard to detect. They may also employ various techniques to avoid detection, maintain persistence, find other valuable targets on a network, and allow attackers to issue commands remotely. The most sophisticated InfoStealers are modular; they can import specific payloads after scanning the environment for potential sources of valuable information.\\n\\nHow Do InfoStealers Work?\\n-------------------------\\n\\nInfoStealer malware employs a variety of techniques to target and extract specific types of data from infected systems. Each strain of malware that is classified as a InfoStealer has different capabilities ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated modular malware. It's also important to remember that data can be stolen from a system using native built-in OS tooling known as a [Living Off The Land (LOTL)](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/what-are-living-off-the-land-attacks/) attack.\\n\\nEach method discussed below targets specific types of data or input-output peripherals. Each method also leverages unique vulnerabilities associated with how that data is used, stored, and transmitted. The diversity of these techniques underscores the necessity for comprehensive security measures that protect not just against one type of threat but a broad array of infiltration strategies.\\n\\nHere are some ways that InfoStealer malware operates:\\n\\n*   **Keylogging**: One of the most common tactics, keylogging involves recording keystrokes made by a user. By capturing everything typed, attackers can later filter out passwords, credit card details, and other sensitive personal information\\n    \\n*   **Form Grabbing**: This technique is used to intercept data submitted in forms on web pages before it is encrypted by the browser. It's particularly effective for stealing login credentials, payment information, and other data entered on websites\\n    \\n*   **Clipboard Hijacking**: InfoStealers can monitor and modify the clipboard content on an infected device. When a user copies data such as account numbers or passwords, the malware replaces or steals this information. This attack technique can even steal usernames and passwords as they are auto-filled by a [password manager](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/password-manager-breach/)\\n    \\n*   **Screen Capturing**: By taking screenshots of the user\\u2019s screen at critical moments\\u2014such as while entering credentials or viewing personal information\\u2014this method can bypass text-based data extraction limitations, capturing data displayed on the screen in any form\\n    \\n*   **Browser Session Hijacking**: This method involves stealing cookies and session tokens from a browser's cached memory which can allow cybercriminals to impersonate the victim's online session, gaining unauthorized access to online accounts without needing a username and password\\n    \\n*   **Credential Dumping**: This method extracts data from user accounts stored on the system, such as login credentials saved in web browsers or other client software. If they are stored in encrypted format, attackers will attempt to crack them offline using specialized hardware and software tools\\n    \\n*   **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks**: These are more sophisticated attacks where the malware injects malicious code [into the web browser itself](https://www.packetlabs.net/posts/how-safe-are-your-browsers/). This allows the attacker to intercept and manipulate information in real-time as it is entered on secure websites\\n    \\n*   **Email Harvesting**: The malware searches through files and emails stored on the computer to collect email addresses and other contact information, which can be used for spamming or further phishing attacks\\n    \\n*   **Crypto-Wallet Harvesting:** Some InfoStealer malware can search known installation paths for common crypto-wallet software and attempt to steal private keys. Once in the attacker's possession these keys can be used to transfer the victim's cryptocurrency to attacker controlled accounts\\n    \\n\\nThe Most Prolific Strains of InfoStealer Malware\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstimating the exact number of InfoStealer malware strains is challenging due to the constantly evolving nature of malware and the frequent emergence of new variants. However, cybersecurity experts and researchers generally agree that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different strains of InfoStealer malware in existence. This vast range includes everything from well-documented and widely recognized strains to more obscure or specialized ones that target specific geographic regions or sectors.\\n\\n*   [**Zeus (Zbot)**](https://www.cynet.com/malware/zeus-malware-variants-methods-and-history/)**:** Perhaps the most infamous InfoStealer, Zeus primarily targets financial information.

Ducktail malware is typically delivered through a spear-phishing email that contains a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. Once the malware infects a system, it establishes a persistent presence and begins to gather information about the system and the network it is connected to.\\n\\nThis info-stealer is being disseminated through Facebook URLs, employing a technique that redirects users to suspicious websites or pages. Once redirected, users are prompted to manually click on a download button, which initiates the download of malicious files onto their devices. This method of distribution capitalizes on user interaction and engagement to deceive them into downloading the malware. The malicious files obtained through this process pose a significant threat to the security and privacy of the affected users, potentially leading to various harmful consequences such as unauthorized access to sensitive information, system compromise, or further malware infections.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://cdn-igifd.nitrocdn.com/LjFqjuxPeeUzGqzhGkddQHQrbKmisRar/assets/images/optimized/rev-c5d0e80/www.rewterz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/an-emerging-ducktail-infostealer.png)\\n\\nThe research team has been analyzing a series of info-stealing malware, and they have recently come across an interesting campaign involving the PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer. This malware is being actively distributed by disguising itself as a free or cracked application installer for popular software, including games, Microsoft Office applications, and Telegram. Ducktail Infostealer, attributed to a Vietnamese threat group, has been active since 2021 and has primarily targeted Facebook Business accounts to manipulate pages and gain access to financial information.\\n\\nThe Ducktail Infostealer instances were first identified in late 2021. In July 2022, researchers observed that the threat actors were specifically targeting higher-level employees with access to Facebook Business accounts to steal data and take control of the accounts. The earlier versions of Ducktail were based on a binary written in .NET Core and utilized Telegram as its command and control (C2) channel for exfiltrating data. However, in August 2022, a new campaign was observed involving a PHP version of Ducktail Infostealer with new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\\n\\nAccording to an analysis, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting specific employees with administrative or financial access to Facebook Business accounts to a broader audience. The malicious executable files are typically in .ZIP format and are hosted on file-sharing platforms, posing as cracked or free versions of popular applications like Office, games, subtitles, and explicit content files. Compared to previous campaigns, changes have been made in the execution of the malicious code. The threat actors now employ a scripting version where the main stealer code is a PHP script instead of a .NET binary.\\n\\nThe execution flow begins with a fake installer that generates a temporary file, which then re-initiates the installer with a \\\"/Silent\\\" parameter. Another temporary file is created, which drops all the supporting files and malicious files at a specific location on the victim's machine. To achieve persistence, a series of events take place, scheduling tasks to execute the malicious payload, named \\\"libbridged.exe,\\\" daily and at regular intervals.\\n\\nThe stealing of data and its exfiltration are achieved by decrypting the stealer code at runtime in memory. The PHP script performs various actions, such as fetching browser information, extracting stored browser cookies, targeting Facebook Business accounts, searching for cryptocurrency account information in the wallet.dat file, and sending the collected data to the command and control (C&C) server.\\n\\nThe PHP script creates PHP associative arrays to prepare for data transmission to the C&C server. The CURL command is used for sending and receiving files over HTTP, and specific switches are employed during communication.\\n\\nThe script also collects information about installed browsers, retrieves data from the local state file in the Chrome user data directory, decodes sensitive data protected by Chrome's local data encryption, encodes stolen information to base64, and saves it to log files. It specifically targets Facebook pages, including Facebook API graph, Facebook Ads Manager, and Facebook Business accounts, to gather account details, payment cycles, account statuses, funding sources, and other relevant information.\\n\\nAfter completing the data-stealing activities, the PHP script connects to the C&C server to obtain a list of targeted folders and URLs stored in JSON format, which are then used to gather further information. The stolen data is sent to the C&C server in JSON format.\\n\\nTo conclude, the threat actors behind the Ducktail Infostealer campaign are continuously evolving their delivery mechanisms and tactics to steal a wide range of sensitive user and system information, particularly targeting Facebook Business accounts.\\n\\nImpact\\n------\\n\\n*   Sensitive Information Theft\\n*   Credential Theft\\n\\nIndicators of Compromise\\n------------------------\\n\\n#### Domain Name\\n\\n*   bwtraining.nl\\n*   dj-w.nl\\n*   ductri.shop\\n*   evdgoudsmid.nl\\n*   fsh-kpn.nl\\n*   funatfunction.nl\\n*   hakotrailers.nl\\n*   laterremadit.fr\\n*   lwdzuid.nl\\n*   nano-phone.fr\\n*   sgf-advies.nl\\n*   singano.shop\\n*   thediverse.se\\n*   zaoui.nl\\n*   dfgdfgfdgdfgdfg.shop\\n*   dausoviettelpro.online\\n*   insiktnordahl.se\\n\\n#### MD5\\n\\n*   de8d2f3a429b72be0b3fa968e89554c1\\n*   aa424dafb152c8696d472c001463b498\\n*   42df34c8cddcb2ebf793869d4220cc2b\\n*   b5fb2e07d7f0353c9648976d0cd2d9de\\n*   0f548b327788e6352eb262a138c1f87b\\n*   019c5102755e3f50e4d44ca82c9626ef\\n*   c1d0c76c34e1eb3588b05547dede3529\\n*   30e9e32a73933af3083b584af7858a3a\\n*   5cfc95d5f595963bb00c3d6ad96949e9\\n*   424ea05ac23ba6a504c1b193b6c5bcaf\\n*   512be004172b5715d881e0551d99590a\\n*   cff1b30dabdb292a22fa38c65df0bd40\\n*   5ec0d1215f205e9b4e8cd8d8f4095987\\n*   0f47b858719fbd7def7fd7f42b228cc0\\n*   d0b361bab520a5c1ee7c33aa1321100f\\n\\n#### SHA-256\\n\\n*   90523861a28cf8a33cfb2681fcbf029a16d353aea24d7fc47850af420e68835c\\n*   26dcfbc7cb948a84d5a24df6ebe9641a2a6201512aef5def698418a8e25e1fb0\\n*   c84c2d3be279f5eea89b6a40989a7511896c826b62341707971370f817e9b1c9\\n*   1b7d6e68479b6779b3992775faad0224beb3cc572c974b48ab184fec96012693\\n*   2187eab7da2eda3425f76ef8a051d83706304da3457a0188573a0a8d67fbc82b\\n*   5c7296ee878788c0fed596cac75498f11e218fa783fd1f4c92df8994f52049cc\\n*   73d7739688d8ae59c95cb14ea212ab5eedcd10e22cbed323cfbb072de139bc42\\n*   bab2ce1025546d4f5e988c85328d22ed7182dec9e741bcf2010ae0ff7ac5a031\\n*   8b9706472cbac5ddc24bd904b796d2fca6ba0729278ea6a1304815828db57da7\\n*   217bb8f973660942a6272a38702579f32e92f9f14b1f3287900fadb1dd28a542\\n*   0cebcb2df28653ec969bb2961abc2b74e666829f620a53705dcfad8d2c6362b6\\n*   10f158890c91e819b5a80ac17ae3bb96e98fe3a0c2dd97efac0c92b70ac00604\\n*   4c7b635e100b52c3a1ae92630b1933ab51baea8dea2646015b52ac4495887ce4\\n*   4ea385d2ecf3b53ad909c69a05e2906ca5e91be55eb5e12286fa516b516b8889\\n*   663221ff71dc932f91d4a9f6ecbb77cd1afc8d93f77a1e7e4f7d1fc3280dee93\\n\\n#### SHA-1\\n\\n*   86285bb8af48913b041374df15cceeaabb853498\\n*   8e1d5da5924df66077495191c8d5a3b6e1252eb3\\n*   a564a1d75214f10d1d9ef9cab0eb32d7db3008c0\\n*   29d40663e3222ef728cca4d838729325a5a81d5a\\n*   fbd3fecf461ec1de949bdd81a7695e1a11fa37e6\\n*   446e4a72f692bd48407ca073957df7dbbc86764c\\n*   66d7224339e16c08947e8ff7f8ea98b0197977a5\\n*   5d4d4ebcd6a6c7a3194fdd1d7f12ea1fa659bbb8\\n*   7372273c7f1d0417eb3c003395e7f6ddad8c39b0\\n*   5ca4cc70b71208bc3edef432edd01540874054e7\\n*   faaf431589e8121b2af3fa6b8fcffb2286055c9a\\n*   7e20c34516060af5468959edf848e26c1e1747bc\\n*   fa13cfffbfe4303114daa91686a08cb37c908157\\n*   51ea1ac2f86993ebd8b11df5417feaca8a42f55d\\n*   622b8eef1a0491d8e2f57d0c24c9fdd003510c60\\n\\nRemediation\\n-----------\\n\\n*   Block all threat indicators at your respective controls. Search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in your environment utilizing your respective security controls.\\n*   Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts adds an extra layer of security and can help prevent unauthorized access even if your login credentials have been stolen.\\n*   Regularly backing up your important data can help ensure you don't lose any critical information in the event of a malware infection or other data loss event.\\n*   Be wary of emails, attachments, and links from unknown sources. Also, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources or clicking on suspicious ads or pop-ups.\\n*   Make sure all of your software, including your operating system and applications, is up-to-date with the latest security patches. This can help prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by info-stealers and other types of malware.\\n*   Promptly apply security patches and updates for operating systems, software applications, and browsers. This helps to address vulnerabilities that threat actors may exploit to deliver malware.\\n*   Utilize web filtering solutions and URL reputation services to block access to known malicious websites and prevent users from visiting potentially dangerous links, such as those used in Ducktail infostealer campaigns.\\n*   Implement network segmentation to restrict access and isolate critical systems, such as those hosting sensitive financial information or Facebook Business accounts. This prevents lateral movement of malware and limits the impact of a potential compromise.\\n*   Implement robust monitoring solutions to detect any unusual or suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration. Establish an effective incident response plan to quickly respond to and mitigate any potential breaches.\\n*   Maintain regular backups of critical data, including Facebook Business account information, and ensure they are stored securely offline. This enables quick recovery in case of a successful attack or data loss.\"}, {\"title\": \"Understanding and Protecting Against Infostealer Malware: A Comprehensive Guide | Flashpoint\", \"link\": \"https://flashpoint.io/blog/protecting-against-infostealer-malware/\", \"snippet\": \"In this blog we outline the essential steps that organizations can take to safeguard against <strong>infostealer</strong> malware.\", \"content\": \"\"}]\n",
