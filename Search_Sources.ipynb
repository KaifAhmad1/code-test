A children’s hospital, Boeing, the UK’s Royal Mail, and sandwich chain Subway have all been recent victims.\\nBut LockBit’s hacking campaign has come to a juddering halt. A sweeping law enforcement operation, led by police at the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and involving investigators from 10 forces around the world, has infiltrated the ransomware group and taken its systems offline.\\nGraeme Biggar, the director general of the NCA, says the group has been “fundamentally disrupted.” The law enforcement operation, called Operation Cronos, has taken control of LockBit's infrastructure and administration system, seized its dark-web leak site, accessed its source code, seized around 11,000 domains and servers, and obtained details of the group's members. “As of today, LockBit is effectively redundant,” Biggar said at a press conference in London, appearing with law enforcement officials from the FBI and Europol. “We have hacked the hackers,” he says.\\nThe action is one of the largest and potentially most significant ever taken against a cybercrime group. Biggar says the law enforcement officials consider LockBit, which is global in nature, to have been the “most prolific and harmful” ransomware group that has been active in recent years. It was responsible for 25 percent of attacks in the past year. “LockBit ransomware has caused losses of billions,” Biggar says of the overall costs of attacks and recovery.\\nIn addition to the seizing of technical infrastructure, the law enforcement operations around LockBit also include arrests in Poland, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as sanctions for two alleged members of the group who are based in Russia. The group has members spread around the world, the officials said.\\nNicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, says LockBit has received more than $120 million in ransomware payments, and that the action announced against the group is just the start of the clampdowns.\\nThe law enforcement action against LockBit was first revealed when its ransomware website dropped offline on February 19 and was replaced by a holding page saying it had been seized by police. The LockBit group, which debuted as “ABCD” before changing its name, first appeared at the end of 2019. Since then, LockBit has rapidly attacked businesses and grown its name recognition within the cybercrime ecosystem. “LockBit has been a thorn in the side of businesses and governments for years, with well over 3,000 publicly known victims, and [has been] seemingly untouchable,” says Allan Liska, an analyst specializing in ransomware for cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Lockbit’s long roster of victims include various US government organizations, ports, and automotive companies.\\nLockBit operates as a ransomware-as-a-service operation, with a core handful of members creating its malware and running its website and infrastructure. This core group licenses its code to “affiliates,” who launch attacks against companies, steal their data, and try to extort money from them. “LockBit is the last of the ‘open affiliate’ ransomware-as-a-service offerings, meaning anyone willing to cough up the cash can join their program with little or no vetting,” Liska says. “They likely have had hundreds of affiliates over the course of their run.”\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nLockBit affiliates have demanded millions of dollars from companies they hack—in one instance asking for $60 million from a car dealer based in the UK and recently setting a $800,000 ransom for a nonprofit hospital. If companies refuse to pay, their data is published online. Earlier this month, LockBit posted 43 GB of data allegedly stolen from defense firm Boeing. Cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has published a new analysis of the group, says LockBit’s leadership “ceded control to its affiliates” and essentially had “little oversight over affiliates’ actions or choice of victims.” This approach allowed the group to grow quickly but also added an “element of chaos” into its actions, according to Secureworks.\\n“\\u200b\\u200bThey are quite indiscriminate in their targeting,” says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at antivirus company Emsisoft. The police action is likely to be the “most significant ransomware disruption” against a ransomware group to date, Callow says. He says the group has had a “cockroach-like resilience” since it was created, and that the law enforcement action is likely to send “shockwaves” through the largely Russian ransomware ecosystem. “Anybody who collaborated with LockBit will be concerned that law enforcement are now in possession of info that will point to them.\\nAs part of the law enforcement operation, officials say they have obtained a huge trove of information about the operation of LockBit and who its members may be. More than 200 cryptocurrency wallets linked to the group have been seized. Also within the gathered information is company data from ransomware attacks where victims have paid a ransom to LockBit, according to the NCA. “Even when a ransom is paid, it does not guarantee that data will be deleted, despite what the criminals have promised,” the police force says. The law enforcement bodies involved in the takedown have also obtained decryption keys for companies and organizations that have had their data locked but not paid to regain access.\\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1 who has studied the group for years and been in constant contact with its leadership, says LockBit stands out from other cybercrime groups due to its “disciplined” and professionalized nature. The ransomware group has issued updates to its malware and encryption technologies multiple times and tried to stay under the radar, compared to other ransomware groups which have bragged about their activities.\\nDiMaggio says the leader of LockBit, who uses the online persona LockBitSupp, appears not to have been a technically skilled hacker themselves but more likely had a “background” in running a business and handling money. “They literally [ran] it like it was a legitimate business,” DiMaggio says, adding that the group has strictly controlled the systems its core members use to communicate and that LockBitSupp appears to have been skilled in their operational security.\\nHowever, LockBit has also fallen into some boasting and grandstanding. The group organized an essay writing competition on a Russian-language cybercrime forum, with paid prizes for the winners. The most bizarre incident happened in September 2022 when the group offered to pay $1,000 to anyone who got a tattoo of its logo. Around 20 people posted photos and videos of tattoos on their arms, legs, wrists, and more. The group has also offered a bounty of $10 million if someone successfully found and published the real name of the person behind LockBitSupp.\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nAs part of the operation against LockBit, law enforcement officials have repurposed the group's own leak website where it published information about victims. The website now displays—in the style of LockBit—links to the police press release, sanctions, and ransomware recovery tools. Officials say they are planning to publish more information about the group and its activities every day. One icon on the seized LockBit website teases that the identity of LockBitSupp may be revealed this week.\\nThe takedown of LockBit comes as law enforcement agencies around the world have taken a progressively more aggressive approach to cybercrime groups in recent years. Police forces and even military hacking groups have successfully taken operations offline, in some cases claiming to create and share decryption keys to unlock encrypted files. These actions have often been accompanied by sanctions and indictments for key members of the cybercrime underground. The result has been a splintering of the cybercrime ecosystem with large-scale ransomware groups such as Conti and Trickbot breaking up, and some of their members reforming as smaller, less effective ransomware groups.\\nThe takedown operation has—for the time being, at least—stopped one of the most long-lasting, notorious, and persistent ransomware groups. But it comes as payments to ransomware groups have hit record highs, and the threat to businesses remains prolific. Data released by cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis at the start of February revealed that across the whole of 2023, ransomware payments exceeded more than $1.1 billion—the highest they’ve ever been. Many criminals are also based in Russia, which has largely turned a blind eye to their actions and very rarely extradites those wanted abroad.\\nWhile the LockBit takedown is significant, it may be only temporary. Previous ransomware groups have reformed as new brands and continued their hacking and extortion. “Disruption of the LockBit ransomware service would seriously slow down the number of ransomware attacks, even though it might be temporary,” Recorded Future’s Liska says.\\nPerhaps more than anything else, the takedown is likely to send a message to LockBit’s affiliates and act as a sign that the group’s brand is tainted. A screenshot shared by cybersecurity research website VX-Underground appears to show a message received by LockBit affiliates trying to log in to its systems: “We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more. You can thank LockbitSupp and their flawed infrastructure for this situation … we may be in touch with you very soon.”\\nIn recent weeks, DiMaggio says, the LockBitSupp administrator has been behaving more erratically after being banned from two prominent Russian hacking forums. However, DiMaggio believes they may try to bring the group back under the same name. “The guy’s ego is so big and he’s so attached to that brand, I truly do not think that he will rebrand,” DiMaggio says. “Hopefully, it’ll be a watered-down version, and hopefully the real elite affiliates that now work for him will be concerned about working for him again.”\\nUpdated: 2/20/2024, 9:28 am EST: This story has been updated with more details about the takedown of LockBit.\\nAndy Greenberg\\nMatt Burgess\\nAndrew Couts\\nAndy Greenberg\\nAndy Greenberg\\nWilliam Turton\\nNicole Tisdale\\nKate O'Flaherty\\nMore From WIRED\\nReviews and Guides\\n© 2024 Condé Nast.

Ryzhenkov additionally has been linked to the alias mx1r and associated with UNC2165 (an evolution of Evil Corp affiliated actors).”\\n\\nIn May we revealed LockBitsUpp, leader of the LockBit ransomware group, as Dmitry Khoroshev. Today, we can also identify one of his affiliates (known as Beverley) as Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Russian national and key member of cyber criminal group, Evil Corp. pic.twitter.com/SW524RhtiR\\n— National Crime Agency (NCA) (@NCA_UK) October 1, 2024\\n\\nRyzhenkov is also believed to be the right-hand man of Maksim Yakubets, Evil Corp’s founder and leader, better known as Aqua. Yakubets currently has a US$5 million bounty for his arrest.\\nFor their involvement in the cyber gang, 16 Evil Corp members, including Rhyzenkov, have had sanctions imposed on them by the UK. The US imposed seven and Australia imposed three, with both countries placing sanctions on Ryzhenkov.\\nAdditionally, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) imposed a sanction on Ryzhenkov for “using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to attack numerous victims in Texas and throughout the United States and hold their sensitive data for ransom”.\\nBitPaymer is a ransomware variant used by Ryzhenkov and other threat actors to encrypt files on accessed devices.\\nHaving tracked Evil Corp since 2010, major cyber security firm CrowdStrike said it worked with global law enforcement and provided critical threat intelligence and analysis “in support” of the latest announcements.\\n“CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations has tracked INDRIK SPIDER (aka Evil Corp) since 2010. Throughout its tenure, the adversary has developed the Dridex banking Trojan and several ransomware variants, including BitPaymer and WastedLocker,” it said.\\nAccording to the US DOJ, Ryzhenkov would gain unauthorised access to victim devices before deploying BitPaymer. He would then leave a digital ransomware note that contained a ransom demand as well as instructions on how to contact the threat group and pay the ransom.\\n“The Justice Department is using all the tools at its disposal to attack the ransomware threat from every angle,” said Deputy Attorney-General Lisa Monaco.\\n“Today’s charges against Ryzhenkov detail how he and his conspirators stole the sensitive data of innocent Americans and then demanded ransom.\\n“With law enforcement partners here and around the world, we will continue to put victims first and show these criminals that, in the end, they will be the ones paying for their crimes.”\\nLockBit’s reactivated seized leak site will once again be taken down by law enforcement in under a week.\\nThe latest activity was achieved thanks to collaboration between law enforcement agencies from Australia, the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, Romania, and the Netherlands, alongside the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust).\\nLockBit’s dark web leak site was first seized in February this year, with law enforcement taking over the group’s administration environment, arresting two individuals and indicting five others.\\nLike the latest activity, Operation Cronos agencies announced this activity on LockBit’s own site.\\n\\nDaniel Croft\\nBorn in the heart of Western Sydney, Daniel Croft is a passionate journalist with an understanding for and experience writing in the technology space.

Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat.\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international partners, hereafter referred to as “authoring organizations,” are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended mitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization’s defenses against this ransomware operation.\\nThe authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents.\\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13.1. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of LockBit’s activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques.\\nThe LockBit RaaS and its affiliates have negatively impacted organizations, both large and small, across the world. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group maintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant to individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as “affiliates”), and supports affiliates’ deployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits, or a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. Some of the methods LockBit has used to successfully attract affiliates include, but are not limited to:\\nLockBit has been successful through innovation and ongoing development of the group’s administrative panel and the RaaS supporting functions. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit and other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing ransomware.\\nTable 1 shows LockBit RaaS’s innovation and development.\\nTable 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS\\nDate\\nEvent\\nSeptember 2019\\nFirst observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor to LockBit.

In about 13% of those cases, ANSSI was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of its constituents’ networks – as the alerts were related to the threat actor’s online claims. So far, 69 confirmed incidents have been handled by ANSSI. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall ransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR).\\nTable 2: ANSSI-Observed LockBit vs. Overall Ransomware Activity\\nYear\\nNumber of Incidents\\nPercentage of CERT-FR’s Ransomware-Related Activity\\n2020 (from July)\\n4\\n2%\\n2021\\n20\\n10%\\n2022\\n30\\n27%\\n2023\\n15\\n27%\\nTotal (2020-2023)\\n69\\n11%\\nTable 3 shows the number of instances different LockBit strains were observed by ANSSI from July 2020 to present.\\nTable 3: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strain and Number of Instances\\nName of the Strain*\\nNumber of Instances\\nLockBit 2.0 (LockBit Red)\\n26\\nLockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black)\\n23\\nLockBit\\n21\\nLockBit Green\\n1\\nLockBit (pre-encryption)\\n1\\nTotal\\n72**\\nFigure 1: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strains by Year\\nFrom the incidents handled, ANSSI can infer that LockBit 3.0 widely took over from LockBit 2.0 and the original LockBit strain from 2022. In two cases, victims were infected with as many as three different strains of LockBit (LockBit 2.0/Red, LockBit 3.0/Black, and LockBit Green).\\nThe authoring agencies observe data leak sites, where attackers publish the names and captured data of victims if they do not pay ransom or hush money. Additionally, these sites can be used to record alleged victims who have been threatened with a data leak. The term 'victims' may include those who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack having taken place).\\nThe leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates’ victims subjected to secondary extortion. Since 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then exfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Because LockBit only reveals the names and leaked data of victims who refuse to pay the primary ransom to decrypt their data, some LockBit victims may never be named or have their exfiltrated data posted on leak sites. As a result, the leak sites reveal a portion of LockBit affiliates’ total victims. For these reasons, the leak sites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data publication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware attacks.\\nUp to the Q1 2023, a total of 1,653 alleged victims were observed on LockBit leak sites. With the introduction of LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0, the leak sites have changed, with some sources choosing to differentiate leak sites by LockBit versions and others ignoring any differentiation. Over time, and through different evolutions of LockBit, the address and layout of LockBit leak sites have changed and are aggregated under the common denominator of the LockBit name. The introduction of LockBit 2.0 at the end of the Q2 2021 had an immediate impact on the cybercriminal market due to multiple RaaS operations shutting down in May and June 2021 (e.g., DarkSide and Avaddon). LockBit competed with other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020.\\nFigure 2: Alleged Number of Victims Worldwide on LockBit Leak Sites\\nDuring their intrusions, LockBit affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source tools that are intended for legal use. When repurposed by LockBit, these tools are then used for a range of malicious cyber activity, such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling, credential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and batch scripts are observed across most intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and privilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike have also been observed.\\nTable 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed for ransomware operations. The legitimate freeware and open-source tools mentioned in this product are all publicly available and legal. The use of these tools by a threat actor should not be attributed to the freeware and open-source tools, absent specific articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.\\nTable 4: Freeware and Open-Source Tools Used by LockBit Affiliates\\nTool\\nIntended Use\\nRepurposed Use by LockBit Affiliates\\nMITRE ATT&CK ID\\n7-zip\\nCompresses

LockBit affiliates attempt secondary ransomware extortion after detonation of the LockBit variant on the primary target. Once the primary target is hit, LockBit affiliates then attempt to extort the companies that are customers of the primary target. This extortion is in the form of secondary ransomware that locks down services those customers consume. Additionally, the primary target’s customers may be extorted by LockBit affiliates threatening to release those customers’ sensitive information.\\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\\nTables 5-16 show the LockBit affiliate tactics and techniques referenced in this advisory.\\nTable 5: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Initial Access\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nDrive-by Compromise\\nT1189\\nLockBit affiliates gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.\\nExploit Public-Facing Application\\nT1190\\nLockBit affiliates may exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell) in internet-facing systems to gain access to victims’ systems.\\nExternal Remote Services\\nT1133\\nLockBit affiliates exploit RDP to gain access to victims’ networks.\\nPhishing\\nT1566\\nLockBit affiliates use phishing and spearphishing to gain access to victims' networks.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining initial access.\\nTable 6: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Execution\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nExecution\\nTA0002\\nLockBit 3.0 launches commands during its execution.\\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\\nT1059.003\\nLockBit affiliates use batch scripts to execute malicious commands.\\nSoftware Deployment Tools\\nT1072\\nLockBit affiliates may use Chocolatey, a command-line package manager for Windows.\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nSystem Services: Service Execution\\nT1569.002\\nLockBit 3.0 uses PsExec to execute commands or payloads.\\nTable 7: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Persistence\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nBoot or Logon Autostart Execution\\nT1547\\nLockBit affiliates enables automatic logon for persistence.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates may use a compromised user account to maintain persistence on the target network.\\nTable 8: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Privilege Escalation\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nPrivilege Escalation\\nTA0004\\nLockBit affiliates will attempt to escalate to the required privileges if current account privileges are insufficient.\\nAbuse Elevation Control Mechanism\\nT1548\\nLockBit affiliates may use ucmDccwCOM Method in UACMe, a GitHub collection of User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques.\\nBoot or Logon Autostart Execution\\nT1547\\nLockBit affiliates enable automatic logon for privilege escalation.\\nDomain Policy Modification: Group Policy Modification\\nT1484.001\\nLockBit affiliates may create Group Policy for lateral movement and can force group policy updates.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates may use a compromised user account to escalate privileges on a victim’s network.\\nTable 9: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Defense Evasion\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nExecution Guardrails: Environmental Keying\\nT1480.001\\nLockBit 3.0 will only decrypt the main component or continue to decrypt and/or decompress data if the correct password is entered.\\nImpair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\\nT1562.001\\nLockBit 3.0 affiliates use Backstab, Defender Control, GMER, PCHunter, PowerTool, Process Hacker or TDSSKiller to disable EDR processes and services.\\nLockBit 3.0 affiliates use Bat Armor to bypass the PowerShell execution Policy.\\nLockBit affiliates may deploy a batch script, 123.bat, to disable and uninstall antivirus software.\\nLockbit 3.0 may modify and/or disable security tools including EDR and antivirus to avoid possible detection of malware, tools, and activities.\\nIndicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\\nT1070.001\\nLockBit executable clears the Windows Event Logs files.\\nIndicator Removal: File Deletion\\nT1070.004\\nLockBit 3.0 will delete itself from the disk.\\nObfuscated Files or Information\\nT1027\\nLockBit 3.0 will send encrypted host and bot information to its command and control (C2) servers.\\nObfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\\nT1027.002\\nLockBit affiliates may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code.

These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\\nThe listed mitigations are ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactic. Mitigations that apply to multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics are listed under the tactic that occurs earliest in an incident’s lifecycle. For example, account use polices are mitigations for initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and credential access but would be listed under initial access mitigations.\\nImplementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it by applying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond to ransomware before an organization’s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack vectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in this advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack is broken into three phases:\\nFigure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop a ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data. In the Initial Access phase, mitigations working together to deny an attacker network access include securing internet-exposed services, patching devices, implementing MFA, disabling macros, employing application allowlisting, and using logging and alerting. In the Consolidation and Preparation phase, mitigations working together to keep an attacker from accessing network devices are patching devices, using network segmentation, enforcing the principle of least privilege, implementing MFA, and using logging and alerting. Finally, in the Impact on Target phase, mitigations working together to deny or degrade an attacker’s ability to steal and/or encrypt data includes using logging and alerting, using and maintaining backups, and employing application allowlisting.\\nCritical Controls Key\\nFigure 3: Stopping Ransomware Using Layered Mitigations\\nValidate Security Controls\\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.\\nTo get started:\\nThe authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\\nResources\\nReporting\\nThe authoring organizations do not encourage paying ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the authoring organizations urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your country’s respective authorities.\\nDisclaimer\\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

Based on fund transfers to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev, he allegedly earned approximately $230,000 between June 2022 and February 2024.\\n\"Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit co-conspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,\" U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger said.\\nLockBit, which was one of the most prolific ransomware groups, had its infrastructure seized in February 2024 as part of an international law enforcement operation called Cronos. It gained notoriety for targeting more than 2,500 entities in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the U.S. alone.\\nVictims of LockBit\\'s attacks included individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, such as hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, government, and law enforcement agencies. The RaaS is believed to have netted the group at least $500 million in illicit profits.\\nCourt documents show that Panev\\'s computer analyzed following his arrest had administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and contained source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which affiliates used to create custom builds of the ransomware.\\nAlso discovered were access credentials for the LockBit control panel and a tool called StealBit, which allowed the affiliate actors to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised hosts prior to initiating the encryption process.\\n\\nPanev, besides writing and maintaining the LockBit malware code as well as offering technical guidance to the e-crime group, is also accused of exchanging direct messages with Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, the primary administrator who also went by online alias LockBitSupp, discussing development work related to the builder and control panel.\\n\"In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work,\" the DoJ said.\\n\"Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network.\"\\nWith the latest arrest, a total of seven LockBit members – Mikhail Vasiliev, Ruslan Astamirov, Artur Sungatov, Ivan Gennadievich Kondratiev, Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev – have been charged in the U.S.\\nDespite these operational setbacks, the LockBit operators appear to be plotting a comeback, with a new version LockBit 4.0 scheduled for release in February 2025. However, it remains to be seen if the extortion gang can successfully stage a return in light of the ongoing wave of takedowns and charges.\\nSecond Netwalker Ransomware Affiliate Gets 20 Years in Prison#\\nThe development comes as Daniel Christian Hulea, a 30-year-old Romanian affiliate of the NetWalker ransomware operation, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $21,500,000 and his interests in an Indonesian company and a luxury resort property that was financed with ill-gotten proceeds from the attacks.\\nHulea previously pleaded guilty in the U.S. to charges of computer fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy back in June 2024. He was arrested in Romania on July 11, 2023, and subsequently extradited to the U.S.\\n\"As part of his plea agreement, Hulea admitted to using NetWalker to obtain approximately 1,595 bitcoin in ransom payments for himself and a co-conspirator, valued at approximately $21,500,000 at the time of the payments,\" the DoJ said.\\nThe NetWalker ransomware operation particularly singled out the healthcare sector during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was dismantled online in January 2021 when U.S. and Bulgarian authorities seized the dark web sites used by the group. In October 2022, a Canadian affiliate, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\\nRaccoon Stealer Developer Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison#\\nIn related law enforcement news, the DoJ also announced the sentencing of Mark Sokolovsky, a Ukrainian national accused of being the primary developer of the Raccoon Stealer malware, to 60 months in federal prison for one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.\\nThe 28-year-old conspired to offer the Raccoon infostealer as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) to other criminal actors for $200 a month, who then deployed the malware on victims\\' systems using various ruses such as email phishing in order to steal sensitive data. The harvested information was used to commit financial crimes or sold to others on underground forums.\\nSokolovsky, who was extradited from the Netherlands in February 2024, pleaded guilty to the crime in early October and agreed to forfeit $23,975 and pay at least $910,844.61 in restitution.\\n\"Mark Sokolovsky was a key player in an international criminal conspiracy that victimized countless individuals by administering malware which made it cheaper and easier for even amateurs to commit complex cybercrimes,\" said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas.\\n\\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has set up a website where users can check whether their email address shows up in the data stolen by the Raccoon stealer malware. The MaaS operation was taken offline in March 2022 concurrent with Sokolovsky\\'s arrest by Dutch authorities.\\nNYC Man Gets Nearly 6 Years in Prison for Credit Card Trafficking and Money Laundering#\\nThe latest actions also follow the sentencing of a 32-year-old New York City man, Vitalii Antonenko, to time served plus days for his involvement in a criminal scheme that infiltrated systems with SQL injection attacks in order to steal credit card and personal information and offer the data for sale on online criminal marketplaces.\\n\"Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds in order to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership, and control,\" the DoJ noted in May 2020. \"The conspiracy\\'s victims included a hospitality business and non-profit scientific research institution, both located in eastern Massachusetts.\"\\nAntonenko was arrested in March 2019 on his return to the U.S. from Ukraine carrying \"computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.\"\\nIn September 2024, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorized access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.\\nFound this article interesting?

But the group's activities\", 'score': 0.657561, 'raw_content': 'Lockbit Strikes Back After FBI Takedown With New Ransomware Attack Details\\nDespite multiple arrests and being disrupted by global law enforcement, Lockbit ransomware affiliates are still offering up US businesses\\' data. When will Lockbit get shut down for good?\\nThe infamous Lockbit ransomware gang is still active and shared data from five cyberattacks this week despite a global law enforcement infiltration last month.\\nLockbit purportedly posted data from five new victims on its dark web site Thursday, according to cybersecurity firm Falcon Feeds. The victims appear to be two US manufacturing firms, a US infrastructure engineering company, a Canadian oil and energy services company, and a British accounting firm.\\nBut Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft, tells PCMag via email that Lockbit is presenting the data as new attacks when, in fact, the ransomware group is just offering new data. \"None of Lockbit’s new postings seem to relate to new incidents. They’re posting data from old attacks, likely in an effort to rehab their rep and convince affiliates and other business partners that all is well (which it isn’t),\" Callow says.\\n\"Because companies often don’t release details of incidents, it’s impossible to say for sure but, until recently, it certainly appeared that they were posting data from old incidents,\" Callow continued.\\nThe US Department of Justice, FBI, as well as the UK\\'s National Crime Agency (NCA) and other agencies involved previously said they had compromised Lockbit\\'s operations. The FBI seized Lockbit\\'s servers, the law enforcement agencies took an estimated 1,000 decryption keys, and the NCA declared it had \"hacked the hackers.\"\\nBut within a week of the news, Lockbit ransomware hackers were back online, claiming to have been able to preserve their backup servers that didn\\'t use PHP, which was reportedly the government agencies\\' means of entry.\\nTwo alleged Lockbit affiliates were arrested in the Ukraine last month, and the US identified two Russian nationals allegedly connected to the ransomware group and called for their arrest. This month, another previously arrested Russian-Canadian Lockbit member was sentenced to four years in prison for infecting over 1,000 victims with Lockbit ransomware.\\nBut the group\\'s activities appear to be ongoing. The supposed anonymous leader of Lockbit claimed in an interview with The Record this week that they are continuing to attack victims and that while some of Lockbit\\'s members got \"scared,\" \"most\" are still working to deploy ransomware attacks.\\n\"The FBI was not able to completely destroy my infrastructure,\" the Lockbit leader said.\\nRecommended by Our Editors\\nThe NCA previously told PCMag that it anticipated Lockbit would try to resurrect itself, and said that it will continue to work to dismantle the group.\\nLockbit\\'s software has been used for attacks against Boeing, dental insurance firms, and Subway. Apple Silicon Mac computers aren\\'t immune, either.\\nEditors\\' Note: This story has been updated to include comment from Callow.\\nLike What You\\'re Reading?\\nSign up for SecurityWatch newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.\\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

A superseding criminal complaint filed in the District of New Jersey was unsealed today charging a dual Russian and Israeli national for being a developer of the LockBit ransomware group. In August, Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, was arrested in Israel pursuant to a U.S. provisional arrest request with a view towards extradition to the United States. Panev is currently in custody in Israel pending extradition on the charges in the superseding complaint. “The Justice Department’s work going after the world’s most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks, but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Three of the individuals who we allege are responsible for LockBit’s cyberattacks against thousands of victims are now in custody, and we will continue to work alongside our partners to hold accountable all those who lead and enable ransomware attacks.” “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department's commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “We started this year with a coordinated international disruption of LockBit — the most damaging ransomware group in the world. Fast forward to today and three LockBit actors are in custody thanks to the diligence of our investigators and our strong partnerships around the world. This case is a model for ransomware investigations in the years to come.” “The arrest of alleged developer Rostislav Panev is part of the FBI’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and dismantle the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The LockBit group has targeted both public and private sector victims around the world, including schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, as well as small businesses and multi-national corporations. No matter how hidden or advanced the threat, the FBI remains committed to working with our interagency partners to safeguard the cyber ecosystem and hold accountable those who are responsible for these criminal activities.” “The criminal complaint alleges that Rostislav Panev developed malware and maintained the infrastructure for LockBit, which was once the world’s most destructive ransomware group and attacked thousands of victims, causing billions of dollars in damage,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Along with our domestic and international law enforcement partner actions to dismantle LockBit’s infrastructure, the Criminal Division has disrupted LockBit’s operations by charging seven of its key members (including affiliates, developers, and its administrator) and arresting three of these defendants — including Panev. We are especially grateful for our partnerships with authorities in Europol, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, which show that, when likeminded countries work together, cybercriminals will find it harder to escape justice.” “As alleged by the complaint, Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit coconspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “But just like the six other LockBit members previously identified and charged by this office and our FBI and Criminal Division partners, Panev could not remain anonymous and avoid justice indefinitely. He must now answer for his crimes. Today’s announcement represents another blow struck by the United States and our international partners against the LockBit organization, and our efforts will continue relentlessly until the group is fully dismantled and its members brought to justice.” According to the superseding complaint, documents filed in this and related cases, and statements made in court, Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. During that time, Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States. Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit’s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery. LockBit’s members comprised “developers,” like Panev, who designed the LockBit malware code and maintained the infrastructure on which LockBit operated. LockBit’s other members, called “affiliates,” carried out LockBit attacks and extorted ransom payments from LockBit victims. LockBit’s developers and affiliates would then split ransom payments extorted from victims. As alleged in the superseding complaint, at the time of Panev’s arrest in Israel in August, law enforcement discovered on Panev’s computer administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and stored source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which allowed LockBit’s affiliates to generate custom builds of the LockBit ransomware malware for particular victims. On that repository, law enforcement also discovered source code for LockBit’s StealBit tool, which helped LockBit affiliates exfiltrate data stolen through LockBit attacks. Law enforcement also discovered access credentials for the LockBit control panel, an online dashboard maintained by LockBit developers for LockBit’s affiliates and hosted by those developers on the dark web. The superseding complaint also alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator, who, in an indictment unsealed in the District of New Jersey in May, the United States alleged to be Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (Дмитрий Юрьевич Хорошев), also known as LockBitSupp, LockBit, and putinkrab. In those messages, Panev and the LockBit primary administrator discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel. Court documents further indicate that, between June 2022 and February 2024, the primary LockBit administrator made a series of transfers of cryptocurrency, laundered through one or more illicit cryptocurrency mixing services, of approximately $10,000 per month to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev. Those transfers amounted to over $230,000 during that period. In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work, consistent with the transfers identified by U.S. authorities. Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network. Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group. The LockBit Investigation The superseding complaint against, and apprehension of, Panev follows a disruption of LockBit ransomware in February by the United Kingdom (U.K.)’s National Crime Agency (NCA)’s Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization’s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. That disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit’s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by documents filed in this case. The superseding complaint against Panev also follows charges brought in the District of New Jersey against other LockBit members, including its alleged primary creator, developer, and administrator, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. An indictment against Khoroshev unsealed in May alleges that Khoroshev began developing LockBit as early as September 2019, continued acting as the group’s administrator through 2024, a role in which Khoroshev recruited new affiliate members, spoke for the group publicly under the alias “LockBitSupp,” and developed and maintained the infrastructure used by affiliates to deploy LockBit attacks. Khoroshev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at www.tips.fbi.gov/ . A total of seven LockBit members have now been charged in the District of New Jersey. Beyond Panev and Khoroshev, other previously charged LockBit defendants include: In July, two LockBit affiliate members, Mikhail Vasiliev, also known as Ghostrider, Free, Digitalocean90, Digitalocean99, Digitalwaters99, and Newwave110, and Ruslan Astamirov, also known as BETTERPAY, offtitan, and Eastfarmer, pleaded guilty in the District of New Jersey for their participation in the LockBit ransomware group and admitted deploying multiple LockBit attacks against U.S. and foreign victims. Vasiliev and Astamirov are presently in custody awaiting sentencing. In February, in parallel with the disruption operation described above, an indictment was unsealed in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev , also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries. Sungatov and Kondratyev remain at large. In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging Mikhail Matveev , also known as Wazawaka, m1x, Boriselcin, and Uhodiransomwar, with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Matveev remains at large and is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State’s TOC Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at www.tips.fbi.gov/ . The U.S. Department of State’s TOC Rewards Program is offering rewards of: Up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of Khoroshev ; Up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Matveev ; Up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and location of any individuals who hold a key leadership position in LockBit ; and Up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual participating or attempting to participate in LockBit . Information is accepted through the FBI tip website at tips.fbi.gov . Khoroshev, Matveev, Sungatov, and Kondratyev have also been designated for sanctions by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for their roles in launching cyberattacks. Victim Assistance LockBit victims are encouraged to contact the FBI and submit information at www.ic3.gov/ . As announced by the Department in February, law enforcement, through its disruption efforts, has developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Submitting information at the IC3 site will enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted. LockBit victims are also encouraged to visit www.justice.gov/usao-nj/lockbit for case updates and information regarding their rights under U.S. law, including the right to submit victim impact statements and request restitution, in the criminal litigation against Panev, Astamirov, and Vasiliev. The FBI Newark Field Office, under the supervision of Acting Special Agent in Charge Nelson I. Delgado, is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant. Israel’s Office of the State Attorney, Department of International Affairs, and Israel National Police; France’s Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command, Paris Prosecution Office — Cyber Division, and judicial authorities at the Tribunal Judiciare of Paris; Europol; Eurojust; the U.K.’s NCA; Germany’s Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein, Bundeskriminalamt, and the Central Cybercrime Department North Rhine-Westphalia; Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice, Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Canton of Zurich, and Zurich Cantonal Police; Spain’s Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil; Japan’s National Police Agency; Australian Federal Police; Sweden’s Polismyndighetens; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Politie Dienst Regionale Recherche Oost-Brabant of the Netherlands; and Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation have provided significant assistance and coordination in these matters and in the LockBit investigation generally. Trial Attorneys Debra Ireland and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the charges against Panev and the other previously charged LockBit defendants in the District of New Jersey. The Justice Department’s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, Office of International Affairs, and National Security Division also provided significant assistance. Additional details on protecting networks against LockBit ransomware are available at StopRansomware.gov . These include Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Advisories AA23-325A, AA23-165A, and AA23-075A. A criminal complaint is merely an allegation.

A dark web posting, apparently from the administrator of the LockBit ransomware group, has teased the launch of a new version of the threat by posing the question: “Want a Lamborghini, Ferrari and lots of titty girls? Sign up and start your pentester billionaire journey in 5 minutes with us.” It is understood that a new leak website has been prepared for launch, along with a total of five anonymous TOR sites: the official release date for the latest version is cited as Feb. 3, 2025. Forbes LastPass Hackers Allegedly Stole $5 Million This Week—Report By Davey Winder What You Need To Know About The LockBit Ransomware Attack Threat LockBit’s activity has fluctuated month-on-month in 2024 following its takedown in February, Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at cyber security giant NCC Group, said. However, LockBit remained the most active ransomware threat actor in May 2024, responsible for 37% of all attacks, according to NCC Group data. “In July 2024, LockBit 3.0 was also the second most prolific threat actor,” Hull said. That burst of activity appears to have been short-lived, with the group not appearing in the top ten most active threat actors during October and November. LockBit operates on a Ransomware-as-a-Service affiliate model, with their particular structure providing affiliate groups with a central control panel to create their own LockBit samples, manage their victims, publish blog posts, and view statistics regarding their success rates for each attack, Hull said. “RaaS models operate in a pseudo-organizational hierarchy, where the operators of the ransomware variant will get a percentage cut of each successful ransomware attack carried out by their affiliates,” Hull said, “thus minimizing the risk that the operators take on with each campaign.” Like most other current ransomware actors, the LockBit threat deploys a double-extortion methodology of file encryption and sensitive data exfiltration. That data is “subsequently posted on their leak site where interested buyers can now pay for access to the data, a timer extension, or even the data’s deletion,” Hull said, unless the ransom is paid, of course. Forbes FBI Warns Of Brute-Force Password Spy Attacks—What You Need To Know By Davey Winder Suspected LockBit Ransomware Coder Charged By U.S. Department Of Justice Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old with Russian and Israeli citizenship, has been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice on suspicion of being involved ins the development of the LockBit ransomware family malware. The newly unsealed U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, criminal complaint , charges Panev with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with computers. That activity being the development, specifically, of the LockBit ransomware encryptors as well as one of the custom tools used in LockBit ransomware attacks known as StealBit. According to a Bleeping Computer report , Panev was arrested on Aug 18, 2024 in Israel where he remains in custody while a request for his extradition to the U.S. is processed. In the criminal complaint, Jacob A. Walker, a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated that Panev “has provided coding and development services to the LockBit ransomware group since at least as early as in or around January 2022 and has received at least as much as approximately $230,000 in cryptocurrency transfers from the LockBit group during that time.” Panev went on to state that “On May 2, 2024, a grand jury in the District of New Jersey indicted a Russian national, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, on 26 criminal counts based on Khoroshev’s alleged role as the creator and primary developer and administrator of the LockBit group.” The criminal complaint said that, while Khoroshev remains a fugitive, U.S. authorities believe that Panev was “subordinate to Khoroshev in the LockBit group.” Mitigation Methods For Incoming Ransomware Attacks—According To The FBI With ransomware-as-a-service and double-extortion ransom tactics on the increase, the Federal Bureau Of Investigation has warned users to be alert to the risk and provided a number of recommended mitigation methods. The FBI said that organizations should enact three mitigating strategies immediately : Install updates for operating systems, software and firmware as soon as they are released.

The SecurityScorecard Threat Research, Intelligence, Knowledge, and Engagement (STRIKE) Team consulted internal SecurityScorecard data, a strategic partner’s traffic data, and public reporting on the incident to offer further insight into these claims. STRIKE Team researchers identified suspicious activity affecting both companies. The available data does not necessarily confirm LockBit’s claims, but it could reflect malicious activity. Therefore, it merits review by personnel with internal visibility into the affected firms’ networks. Background On June 28, a LockBit-associated threat actor known as “Bassterlord” claimed to have mounted a ransomware attack against a major semiconductor manufacturer and posted screenshots suggesting access to its systems in a series of since-deleted tweets. An entry for the company appeared on LockBit’s data leak site the following day. In the wake of these claims, the company denied that the attack had affected its operations or exposed customer data. Instead, it reported that an attack against a hardware supplier had exposed a limited amount of its data. LockBit is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that has operated since 2019 and rebranded twice, first as LockBit 2.0 in January 2021 and again as LockBit 3.0 or LockBit Black in Spring 2022. In March 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a #StopRansomware alert about the group in which it identified remote desktop protocol (RDP) compromise, drive-by compromise, phishing, abuse of valid accounts, and exploitation of public-facing applications as initial access techniques observed in LockBit attacks. The alert also noted that the group has used a custom tool, Stealbit, and web services for data exfiltration. In Summer and Fall 2022, LockBit made several false or exaggerated breach claims against prominent organizations. The group added an entry for Mandiant (a large cybersecurity firm that Google has since acquired) to its data leak site in June 2022. Despite initially boasting of having stolen a large number of files, the group ultimately only released two files, neither of which contained Mandiant data. Following an internal investigation that revealed no evidence of compromise, Mandiant hypothesized that the group was using the claim to garner publicity in hopes of leveraging the attention to dispute Mandiant’s then-recent assessment linking LockBit to the sanctioned Evil Corp cybercrime group. Then, on October 31, the group claimed that it had compromised the network of defense contractor Thales Group and threatened to leak files if it did not receive a ransom by November 7. However, by November 3, Thales stated that they had observed no evidence of an intrusion, and LockBit did not release any Thales data on the original deadline of November 7. The group did leak some Thales-relevant data on November 10, after which Thales issued a press release denying any impact on its operations and confirming its previous assessment that the company’s IT systems did not suffer an intrusion and further explaining that LockBit had likely obtained a limited amount of data by compromising a partner account and accessing a collaboration platform. Similarly, on December 2, the group claimed to have exfiltrated data from another major defense contractor. Initially, LockBit threatened to publish the stolen files if the firm did not pay a ransom by December 9. However, LockBit never published this data and eventually removed the company’s entry from its data leak site. Despite the possibility that LockBit has again exaggerated its claims, the STRIKE Team consulted internal SecurityScorecard data, a strategic partner’s traffic data, and public reporting on the incident to offer further insight into the group’s recent claims. Findings STRIKE Team researchers identified suspicious activity affecting both the semiconductor manufacturer and its supplier. The available data does not necessarily confirm LockBit’s claims but could reflect malicious activity. Researchers observed extended communication between a manufacturer-attributed IP address and three foreign IP addresses belonging to organizations without clear business relationships with it. All of these exchanges used the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which has legitimate uses but appears relatively infrequently in the traffic samples the STRIKE Team analyzes. In this particular dataset, communications with these three IP addresses are responsible for almost all flows over ICMP; this traffic therefore appears strange, if not malicious. It further bears noting that threat actors can use ICMP for command and control (C2) communications, which these flows may reflect. Port 22 was additionally open and running vulnerable software at all the external IP addresses involved in these communications. So, it is possible that threat actors accessed these IP addresses over SSH (possibly by exploiting the observed vulnerabilities) and then subsequently used them to communicate with the manufacturer IP address involved. Images 1-3: SecurityScorecard’s Attack Surface Intelligence module indicates that vulnerable ports were open at three IP addresses that established extended connections with an IP address attributed to the semiconductor manufacturer. In addition, researchers observed sixty transfers larger than 50 MB from manufacturer-attributed IP addresses to thirty-nine IP addresses that belong to a large hosting provider. While traffic to these commercial servers could reflect transfers to backups or other benign activity, given that large transfers can also represent exfiltration, in light of the circumstances, review by personnel with internal visibility into the affected company’s network is likely appropriate. The supplier’s traffic sample revealed that it experienced considerable suspicious activity. The majority of flows in the sample (10,751 of 14,118 ) saw two supplier-attributed IP addresses contacting 209.197.3[.]8, which ten vendors who contribute detections to VirusTotal have linked to malicious activity. Although it belongs to a legitimate content delivery network (CDN) and serves legitimate downloads, members of the cybersecurity community have also observed various strains of malware communicating with this IP address. That being the case, the regular contact between it and supplier-attributed IP addresses may suggest malware infections on devices at the IP addresses attributed to the hardware supplier. These infections could have led to the theft of credentials that attackers leveraged in a later stage of the attack or the delivery of ransomware as a later stage payload. The sample additionally contains 80 instances of communication between supplier-attributed IP addresses and addresses that the strategic partner that provides SecurityScorecard’s traffic data identifies as proxies or virtual private network (VPN) or TOR exit nodes from May 9 to July 1. While communication with proxies such as these is not necessarily malicious, given that threat actors often use them, some of these flows could reflect the activity that culminated in the breach that the supplier disclosed. Port 25 of another IP address attributed to the hardware supplier communicated particularly frequently with VPN-linked IP addresses on May 25, May 27, and June 1. Other traffic may additionally suggest that the targeting of port 25 was more extensive. It repeatedly communicated with foreign IP addresses between May 5 and July 3, experiencing fifty-four notably long sessions and sixty-six sessions featuring data exchanges across multiple client ports. These could also reflect the operation of malware within the supplier’s network, as information-stealing malware (which can compromise credentials for subsequent use by attackers) sometimes uses SMTP, which usually runs at port 25, for command and control (C2) communications or exfiltration . STRIKE Team researchers additionally identified a group of transfers of 10 MB or more from supplier-attributed IP addresses, which could reflect exfiltration. These included eight flows of 12.29 MB to a group of IP addresses that included some identified as VPN nodes between May 25 and June 20, one 11.63-MB transfer to 146.190.226[.]176 on June 11, and three 10.26-MB transfers from 165.227.153[.]96 , 139.59.162[.]165 , and 161.35.153[.]99 on May 24, 29, and 30. While the uniform size of some of these transfers could suggest that they represent routine behavior, given the supplier’s confirmation of a breach, they may merit further investigation as they could include IP addresses that threat actors used to steal the data exposed in the breach. Files contained in the cybersecurity information-sharing platform VirusTotal also suggested that both companies have experienced suspicious activity over the past year, though none are clearly connected to the recent claim. A PDF file of an email dated June 26, which may reflect phishing targeting the semiconductor manufacturer, appeared on VirusTotal on June 27. Phishing messages often attempt to provoke hasty action in their recipients by discussing what appear to be urgent matters. In this case, the message’s discussion of sudden changes to an interview about employees’ visa applications could indicate such an attempt. While this file may be less likely to represent phishing because it currently has no detections in VirusTotal, another that contains a company email address and appeared in VirusTotal on April 25 is likely malicious. Thirty vendors detect it as malicious, and many of these detections link it to phishing. It is an HTML file containing input fields for an email address and password, which suggests that it corresponds to a credential-harvesting page distributed either via a malicious link or HTML phishing. A manufacturer email address appears in the file’s title, suggesting that it targeted the particular employee whose email address the title contains. The available files suggesting targeting of the hardware supplier appeared in VirusTotal earlier than those containing the manufacturer’s domain. Two files suggesting a compromise of a supplier email account appeared in October 2022. Two vendors have linked each file to phishing, and both contain the same supplier email address in the “from” line. This may suggest a threat actor had compromised the email address contained in the files and used it to distribute phishing emails to targets at other organizations. Prior to these, a file that four vendors detect as malicious and which communicated with multiple supplier domains appeared on VirusTotal in August 2022. Two of these detections (Ransom.Win64.Wacatac.sa and BehavesLike.Win64.Ransom.wc) suggest a connection to ransomware. Still, given the timing of the submission to VirusTotal relative to the date of the breach announcement, it is unlikely that this file is related to the recent incident. It may nonetheless suggest that previous malicious activity affected the company and could offer additional background information regarding the targeting of the company. Methodology \\u200b\\u200b STRIKE Team researchers leveraged network flow (NetFlow) data furnished by a strategic partner to collect samples of traffic involving IP addresses attributed to the semiconductor manufacturer and its hardware supplier. Researchers included all of the IP addresses SecurityScorecard’s ratings platform attributes to the supplier (nineteen in total). However, due to the constraints of the NetFlow tool available, collected traffic samples for relatively small fractions of the more than 6,000 IP addresses attributed to the manufacturer. Researchers collected samples from two groups of manufacturer-attributed IP addresses. The first consisted of IP addresses where SecurityScorecard detected issues, given that threat actors may be more likely to target IP addresses affected by the issues SecurityScorecard observes. The second consisted of manufacturer-attributed IP addresses ending in 31, as a screenshot provided by the threat actor claiming the breach appeared to contain an IP address ending in 31. Image 4: The LockBit associate who first claimed the attack included this screenshot to prove their access to manufacturer systems (source: VX-Underground ). Publicly-available reporting on the incident indicates that threat actors provided a screenshot alongside the claim of the attack, which purportedly proves their access to manufacturer systems and displays a browser’s address bar. The address in the published version of the screenshot is mostly obfuscated but appears to end in 31. According to SecurityScorecard’s digital footprints, seventy-two IP addresses attributed to the manufacturer end in 31, but none attributed to the supplier do. STRIKE Team researchers, therefore, collected and analyzed a traffic sample for these seventy-two IP addresses to assess the possibility that the screenshot reflected a compromise of any of these manufacturer-attributed IP addresses, which could suggest that the breach affected the manufacturer itself in addition to its supplier. STRIKE Team researchers collected this sample to further assess this possibility. Finally, STRIKE Team researchers searched for files containing both firms’ domains in VirusTotal to identify other evidence of malicious activity. Conclusion While the available information may suggest that both the supplier and the manufacturer experienced suspicious activity, it does not necessarily confirm LockBit’s claims to have compromised the semiconductor manufacturer’s systems. It first bears noting that suspicious traffic constitutes a much larger portion of the supplier’s traffic sample than either of the manufacturer’s traffic samples and may therefore be more likely to indicate compromise, which could support the manufacturer’s explanation that the supplier’s breach exposed some of the manufacturing company’s data. However, LockBit may additionally have exaggerated or fabricated its claims. As discussed above, LockBit has previously made false or overstated claims of breaches affecting politically-relevant firms like defense contractors. Given the strategic importance of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, and increasing public awareness of the geopolitical sensitivities surrounding the industry, LockBit may be attempting to take advantage of increased attention to the semiconductor manufacturer and extract a payment from it based on the publicity their claim generated rather than the amount of data accessed. This incident is comparable to LockBit’s November 2022 attempt to extort Thales Group. In that case, LockBit claimed to have compromised Thales Group but had, according to Thales, only accessed a comparatively small amount of the company’s data that a third party had exposed. In this one, LockBit has added an entry for a prominent semiconductor manufacturer to its data leak site, but the named company has linked the compromise to a supplier that has confirmed that a breach recently exposed its customers’ data.', highlights=['Executive Summary On June 29, the LockBit ransomware group added an entry for a major semiconductor manufacturer to its data leak site.
