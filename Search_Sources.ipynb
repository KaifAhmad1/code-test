Nicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, says LockBit has received more than $120 million in ransomware payments, and that the action announced against the group is just the start of the clampdowns.\\n A screenshot shared by cybersecurity research website VX-Underground appears to show a message received by LockBit affiliates trying to log in to its systems: “We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more. In addition to the seizing of technical infrastructure, the law enforcement operations around LockBit also include arrests in Poland, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as sanctions for two alleged members of the group who are based in Russia.', 'score': 0.780947, 'raw_content': \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.\\nMatt Burgess\\nA Global Police Operation Just Took Down the Notorious LockBit Ransomware Gang\\nFor the past four years, the LockBit ransomware group has been on an unrelenting rampage, hacking into thousands of businesses, schools, medical facilities, and governments around the world—and making millions in the process. A children’s hospital, Boeing, the UK’s Royal Mail, and sandwich chain Subway have all been recent victims.\\nBut LockBit’s hacking campaign has come to a juddering halt. A sweeping law enforcement operation, led by police at the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and involving investigators from 10 forces around the world, has infiltrated the ransomware group and taken its systems offline.\\nGraeme Biggar, the director general of the NCA, says the group has been “fundamentally disrupted.” The law enforcement operation, called Operation Cronos, has taken control of LockBit's infrastructure and administration system, seized its dark-web leak site, accessed its source code, seized around 11,000 domains and servers, and obtained details of the group's members. “As of today, LockBit is effectively redundant,” Biggar said at a press conference in London, appearing with law enforcement officials from the FBI and Europol. “We have hacked the hackers,” he says.\\nThe action is one of the largest and potentially most significant ever taken against a cybercrime group. Biggar says the law enforcement officials consider LockBit, which is global in nature, to have been the “most prolific and harmful” ransomware group that has been active in recent years. It was responsible for 25 percent of attacks in the past year. “LockBit ransomware has caused losses of billions,” Biggar says of the overall costs of attacks and recovery.\\nIn addition to the seizing of technical infrastructure, the law enforcement operations around LockBit also include arrests in Poland, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as sanctions for two alleged members of the group who are based in Russia. The group has members spread around the world, the officials said.\\nNicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, says LockBit has received more than $120 million in ransomware payments, and that the action announced against the group is just the start of the clampdowns.\\nThe law enforcement action against LockBit was first revealed when its ransomware website dropped offline on February 19 and was replaced by a holding page saying it had been seized by police. The LockBit group, which debuted as “ABCD” before changing its name, first appeared at the end of 2019. Since then, LockBit has rapidly attacked businesses and grown its name recognition within the cybercrime ecosystem. “LockBit has been a thorn in the side of businesses and governments for years, with well over 3,000 publicly known victims, and [has been] seemingly untouchable,” says Allan Liska, an analyst specializing in ransomware for cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Lockbit’s long roster of victims include various US government organizations, ports, and automotive companies.\\nLockBit operates as a ransomware-as-a-service operation, with a core handful of members creating its malware and running its website and infrastructure. This core group licenses its code to “affiliates,” who launch attacks against companies, steal their data, and try to extort money from them. “LockBit is the last of the ‘open affiliate’ ransomware-as-a-service offerings, meaning anyone willing to cough up the cash can join their program with little or no vetting,” Liska says. “They likely have had hundreds of affiliates over the course of their run.”\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nLockBit affiliates have demanded millions of dollars from companies they hack—in one instance asking for $60 million from a car dealer based in the UK and recently setting a $800,000 ransom for a nonprofit hospital. If companies refuse to pay, their data is published online. Earlier this month, LockBit posted 43 GB of data allegedly stolen from defense firm Boeing. Cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has published a new analysis of the group, says LockBit’s leadership “ceded control to its affiliates” and essentially had “little oversight over affiliates’ actions or choice of victims.” This approach allowed the group to grow quickly but also added an “element of chaos” into its actions, according to Secureworks.\\n“\\u200b\\u200bThey are quite indiscriminate in their targeting,” says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at antivirus company Emsisoft. The police action is likely to be the “most significant ransomware disruption” against a ransomware group to date, Callow says. He says the group has had a “cockroach-like resilience” since it was created, and that the law enforcement action is likely to send “shockwaves” through the largely Russian ransomware ecosystem. “Anybody who collaborated with LockBit will be concerned that law enforcement are now in possession of info that will point to them.\\nAs part of the law enforcement operation, officials say they have obtained a huge trove of information about the operation of LockBit and who its members may be. More than 200 cryptocurrency wallets linked to the group have been seized. Also within the gathered information is company data from ransomware attacks where victims have paid a ransom to LockBit, according to the NCA. “Even when a ransom is paid, it does not guarantee that data will be deleted, despite what the criminals have promised,” the police force says. The law enforcement bodies involved in the takedown have also obtained decryption keys for companies and organizations that have had their data locked but not paid to regain access.\\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1 who has studied the group for years and been in constant contact with its leadership, says LockBit stands out from other cybercrime groups due to its “disciplined” and professionalized nature. The ransomware group has issued updates to its malware and encryption technologies multiple times and tried to stay under the radar, compared to other ransomware groups which have bragged about their activities.\\nDiMaggio says the leader of LockBit, who uses the online persona LockBitSupp, appears not to have been a technically skilled hacker themselves but more likely had a “background” in running a business and handling money. “They literally [ran] it like it was a legitimate business,” DiMaggio says, adding that the group has strictly controlled the systems its core members use to communicate and that LockBitSupp appears to have been skilled in their operational security.\\nHowever, LockBit has also fallen into some boasting and grandstanding. The group organized an essay writing competition on a Russian-language cybercrime forum, with paid prizes for the winners. The most bizarre incident happened in September 2022 when the group offered to pay $1,000 to anyone who got a tattoo of its logo. Around 20 people posted photos and videos of tattoos on their arms, legs, wrists, and more. The group has also offered a bounty of $10 million if someone successfully found and published the real name of the person behind LockBitSupp.\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nAs part of the operation against LockBit, law enforcement officials have repurposed the group's own leak website where it published information about victims. The website now displays—in the style of LockBit—links to the police press release, sanctions, and ransomware recovery tools. Officials say they are planning to publish more information about the group and its activities every day. One icon on the seized LockBit website teases that the identity of LockBitSupp may be revealed this week.\\nThe takedown of LockBit comes as law enforcement agencies around the world have taken a progressively more aggressive approach to cybercrime groups in recent years. Police forces and even military hacking groups have successfully taken operations offline, in some cases claiming to create and share decryption keys to unlock encrypted files. These actions have often been accompanied by sanctions and indictments for key members of the cybercrime underground. The result has been a splintering of the cybercrime ecosystem with large-scale ransomware groups such as Conti and Trickbot breaking up, and some of their members reforming as smaller, less effective ransomware groups.\\nThe takedown operation has—for the time being, at least—stopped one of the most long-lasting, notorious, and persistent ransomware groups. But it comes as payments to ransomware groups have hit record highs, and the threat to businesses remains prolific. Data released by cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis at the start of February revealed that across the whole of 2023, ransomware payments exceeded more than $1.1 billion—the highest they’ve ever been. Many criminals are also based in Russia, which has largely turned a blind eye to their actions and very rarely extradites those wanted abroad.\\nWhile the LockBit takedown is significant, it may be only temporary. Previous ransomware groups have reformed as new brands and continued their hacking and extortion. “Disruption of the LockBit ransomware service would seriously slow down the number of ransomware attacks, even though it might be temporary,” Recorded Future’s Liska says.\\nPerhaps more than anything else, the takedown is likely to send a message to LockBit’s affiliates and act as a sign that the group’s brand is tainted. A screenshot shared by cybersecurity research website VX-Underground appears to show a message received by LockBit affiliates trying to log in to its systems: “We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more. You can thank LockbitSupp and their flawed infrastructure for this situation … we may be in touch with you very soon.”\\nIn recent weeks, DiMaggio says, the LockBitSupp administrator has been behaving more erratically after being banned from two prominent Russian hacking forums. However, DiMaggio believes they may try to bring the group back under the same name. “The guy’s ego is so big and he’s so attached to that brand, I truly do not think that he will rebrand,” DiMaggio says. “Hopefully, it’ll be a watered-down version, and hopefully the real elite affiliates that now work for him will be concerned about working for him again.”\\nUpdated: 2/20/2024, 9:28 am EST: This story has been updated with more details about the takedown of LockBit.\\nAndy Greenberg\\nMatt Burgess\\nAndrew Couts\\nAndy Greenberg\\nAndy Greenberg\\nWilliam Turton\\nNicole Tisdale\\nKate O'Flaherty\\nMore From WIRED\\nReviews and Guides\\n© 2024 Condé Nast.

            "Text: Note : A copy of the superseding criminal complaint can be found here . A superseding criminal complaint filed in the District of New Jersey was unsealed today charging a dual Russian and Israeli national for being a developer of the LockBit ransomware group. In August, Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, was arrested in Israel pursuant to a U.S. provisional arrest request with a view towards extradition to the United States. Panev is currently in custody in Israel pending extradition on the charges in the superseding complaint. “The Justice Department’s work going after the world’s most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks, but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Three of the individuals who we allege are responsible for LockBit’s cyberattacks against thousands of victims are now in custody, and we will continue to work alongside our partners to hold accountable all those who lead and enable ransomware attacks.” “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department's commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “We started this year with a coordinated international disruption of LockBit — the most damaging ransomware group in the world. Fast forward to today and three LockBit actors are in custody thanks to the diligence of our investigators and our strong partnerships around the world. This case is a model for ransomware investigations in the years to come.” “The arrest of alleged developer Rostislav Panev is part of the FBI’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and dismantle the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The LockBit group has targeted both public and private sector victims around the world, including schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, as well as small businesses and multi-national corporations. No matter how hidden or advanced the threat, the FBI remains committed to working with our interagency partners to safeguard the cyber ecosystem and hold accountable those who are responsible for these criminal activities.” “The criminal complaint alleges that Rostislav Panev developed malware and maintained the infrastructure for LockBit, which was once the world’s most destructive ransomware group and attacked thousands of victims, causing billions of dollars in damage,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Along with our domestic and international law enforcement partner actions to dismantle LockBit’s infrastructure, the Criminal Division has disrupted LockBit’s operations by charging seven of its key members (including affiliates, developers, and its administrator) and arresting three of these defendants — including Panev. We are especially grateful for our partnerships with authorities in Europol, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, which show that, when likeminded countries work together, cybercriminals will find it harder to escape justice.” “As alleged by the complaint, Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit coconspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “But just like the six other LockBit members previously identified and charged by this office and our FBI and Criminal Division partners, Panev could not remain anonymous and avoid justice indefinitely. He must now answer for his crimes. Today’s announcement represents another blow struck by the United States and our international partners against the LockBit organization, and our efforts will continue relentlessly until the group is fully dismantled and its members brought to justice.” According to the superseding complaint, documents filed in this and related cases, and statements made in court, Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. During that time, Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States. Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit’s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery. LockBit’s members comprised “developers,” like Panev, who designed the LockBit malware code and maintained the infrastructure on which LockBit operated. LockBit’s other members, called “affiliates,” carried out LockBit attacks and extorted ransom payments from LockBit victims. LockBit’s developers and affiliates would then split ransom payments extorted from victims. As alleged in the superseding complaint, at the time of Panev’s arrest in Israel in August, law enforcement discovered on Panev’s computer administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and stored source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which allowed LockBit’s affiliates to generate custom builds of the LockBit ransomware malware for particular victims. On that repository, law enforcement also discovered source code for LockBit’s StealBit tool, which helped LockBit affiliates exfiltrate data stolen through LockBit attacks. Law enforcement also discovered access credentials for the LockBit control panel, an online dashboard maintained by LockBit developers for LockBit’s affiliates and hosted by those developers on the dark web. The superseding complaint also alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator, who, in an indictment unsealed in the District of New Jersey in May, the United States alleged to be Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (Дмитрий Юрьевич Хорошев), also known as LockBitSupp, LockBit, and putinkrab. In those messages, Panev and the LockBit primary administrator discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel. Court documents further indicate that, between June 2022 and February 2024, the primary LockBit administrator made a series of transfers of cryptocurrency, laundered through one or more illicit cryptocurrency mixing services, of approximately $10,000 per month to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev. Those transfers amounted to over $230,000 during that period. In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work, consistent with the transfers identified by U.S. authorities. Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network. Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group. The LockBit Investigation The superseding complaint against, and apprehension of, Panev follows a disruption of LockBit ransomware in February by the United Kingdom (U.K.)’s National Crime Agency (NCA)’s Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization’s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. That disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit’s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by documents filed in this case. The superseding complaint against Panev also follows charges brought in the District of New Jersey against other LockBit members, including its alleged primary creator, developer, and administrator, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. An indictment against Khoroshev unsealed in May alleges that Khoroshev began developing LockBit as early as September 2019, continued acting as the group’s administrator through 2024, a role in which Khoroshev recruited new affiliate members, spoke for the group publicly under the alias “LockBitSupp,” and developed and maintained the infrastructure used by affiliates to deploy LockBit attacks. Khoroshev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at www.tips.fbi.gov/ . A total of seven LockBit members have now been charged in the District of New Jersey. Beyond Panev and Khoroshev, other previously charged LockBit defendants include: In July, two LockBit affiliate members, Mikhail Vasiliev, also known as Ghostrider, Free, Digitalocean90, Digitalocean99, Digitalwaters99, and Newwave110, and Ruslan Astamirov, also known as BETTERPAY, offtitan, and Eastfarmer, pleaded guilty in the District of New Jersey for their participation in the LockBit ransomware group and admitted deploying multiple LockBit attacks against U.S. and foreign victims. Vasiliev and Astamirov are presently in custody awaiting sentencing. In February, in parallel with the disruption operation described above, an indictment was unsealed in the District of New Jersey charging Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev , also known as Bassterlord, with deploying LockBit against numerous victims throughout the United States, including businesses nationwide in the manufacturing and other industries, as well as victims around the world in the semiconductor and other industries. Sungatov and Kondratyev remain at large. In May 2023, two indictments were unsealed in Washington, D.C., and the District of New Jersey charging Mikhail Matveev , also known as Wazawaka, m1x, Boriselcin, and Uhodiransomwar, with using different ransomware variants, including LockBit, to attack numerous victims throughout the United States, including the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Matveev remains at large and is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State’s TOC Rewards Program, with information accepted through the FBI tip website at www.tips.fbi.gov/ . The U.S. Department of State’s TOC Rewards Program is offering rewards of: Up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of Khoroshev ; Up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Matveev ; Up to $10 million for information leading to the identification and location of any individuals who hold a key leadership position in LockBit ; and Up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction in any country of any individual participating or attempting to participate in LockBit . Information is accepted through the FBI tip website at tips.fbi.gov . Khoroshev, Matveev, Sungatov, and Kondratyev have also been designated for sanctions by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control for their roles in launching cyberattacks. Victim Assistance LockBit victims are encouraged to contact the FBI and submit information at www.ic3.gov/ . As announced by the Department in February, law enforcement, through its disruption efforts, has developed decryption capabilities that may enable hundreds of victims around the world to restore systems encrypted using the LockBit ransomware variant. Submitting information at the IC3 site will enable law enforcement to determine whether affected systems can be successfully decrypted. LockBit victims are also encouraged to visit www.justice.gov/usao-nj/lockbit for case updates and information regarding their rights under U.S. law, including the right to submit victim impact statements and request restitution, in the criminal litigation against Panev, Astamirov, and Vasiliev. The FBI Newark Field Office, under the supervision of Acting Special Agent in Charge Nelson I. Delgado, is investigating the LockBit ransomware variant. Israel’s Office of the State Attorney, Department of International Affairs, and Israel National Police; France’s Gendarmerie Nationale Cyberspace Command, Paris Prosecution Office — Cyber Division, and judicial authorities at the Tribunal Judiciare of Paris; Europol; Eurojust; the U.K.’s NCA; Germany’s Landeskriminalamt Schleswig-Holstein, Bundeskriminalamt, and the Central Cybercrime Department North Rhine-Westphalia; Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice, Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Canton of Zurich, and Zurich Cantonal Police; Spain’s Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil; Japan’s National Police Agency; Australian Federal Police; Sweden’s Polismyndighetens; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Politie Dienst Regionale Recherche Oost-Brabant of the Netherlands; and Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation have provided significant assistance and coordination in these matters and in the LockBit investigation generally. Trial Attorneys Debra Ireland and Jorge Gonzalez of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew M. Trombly, David E. Malagold, and Vinay Limbachia for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the charges against Panev and the other previously charged LockBit defendants in the District of New Jersey. The Justice Department’s Cybercrime Liaison Prosecutor to Eurojust, Office of International Affairs, and National Security Division also provided significant assistance. Additional details on protecting networks against LockBit ransomware are available at StopRansomware.gov . These include Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Advisories AA23-325A, AA23-165A, and AA23-075A. A criminal complaint is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n",
