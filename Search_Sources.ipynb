            "Text: An alleged LockBit ransomware developer is in custody in Israel and awaiting extradition to the United States. Israeli law enforcement arrested Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, in August at the request of the US. Panev faces 41 counts, including computer-related extortion, conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and intentional damage to a protected computer, according to a criminal complaint [ PDF ] filed in the District of New Jersey that was unsealed on December 20. With the addition of Panev, seven LockBit members have been charged with crimes and three have been arrested . \"We started this year with a coordinated international disruption of LockBit – the most damaging ransomware group in the world,\" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement . \"Fast forward to today and three LockBit actors are in custody thanks to the diligence of our investigators and our strong partnerships around the world.\" LockBit, the notorious ransomware gang that began infecting victims around January 2020, more or less ended with the UK-led disruption and website seizure in February, followed by the unmasking of the crew's alleged kingpin, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, aka LockBitSupp. The feds unsealed an indictment against Khoroshev in May, and he currently has a $10 million bounty on his head. While the scumbags still claim victims and have even teased a new version of their malware, the criminal operation is a shadow of its former self . In total, the criminals infected more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries, including 1,800 in the US, according to the Justice Department. The group's affiliates extorted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses. From the group's inception around 2019 through February 2024, Panev worked as a LockBit developer, according to the criminal complaint. At the time of his arrest in August, Israeli cops reportedly searched Panev's computer and discovered credentials for a Git repository that contained source code for LockBit's ESXi, Linux, Proxmox, and Nutanix builders; source code for the Conti ransomware variant; source code for the StealBit custom data exfiltration tool; and a copy of the LockBit 3.0 ransom note. The complaint says they also found access credentials for the LockBit control panel on Panev's machine: Prior to his arrest, US authorities say they obtained evidence showing that Panev exchanged direct messages with Khoroshev on a darkweb forum identified as \"Forum-1,\" during which the two discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel. Between June 2022 and February 2024, Khoroshev made a series of payments to Panev, laundered through various cryptocurrency mixing services, of about $10,000 per month, the court documents allege. After he was arrested in August, Panev \"agreed to multiple voluntary interviews with Israeli authorities,\" the complaint says. During those interviews, he reportedly admitted his correspondence with LockBit began around 2019 and he performed several coding jobs for the gang in exchange for compensation. \"Those jobs included, among other things, writing code to disable the Windows Defender antivirus system (presumably, to allow a malware payload, like a LockBit build, to be deployed on a victim computer); writing code to deploy malware throughout a network via the Windows Active Directory service; and writing code to print a given text on all printers on a given network (presumably, the LockBit ransom note),\" according to the criminal complaint. Euro cops arrest 4 including suspected LockBit dev chilling on holiday NCA unmasks man it suspects is both 'Evil Corp kingpin' and LockBit affiliate Five months after takedown, LockBit is a shadow of its former self LockBit dethroned as leading ransomware gang for first time post-takedown Later during his tenure, Panev admitted to writing code for LockBit's encryption malware and providing technical guidance to the gang, and that's when the monthly $10,000 payments began rolling in. But in perhaps our favorite part of the 48-page court document, Panev allegedly told the Israeli authorities that at first he didn't realize the work he was doing for LockBit was illegal. \"Panev claimed – dubiously, in the assessment of US authorities, given the nature of the services he acknowledged providing from the very beginning of his work for LockBit and his own extensive familiarity with computer science, hacking, and cybercrime, as discussed in this Affidavit – that he at first did not realize that the work he was doing for LockBit was unlawful,\" it reads. Later, however, he did catch on to the fact that he was providing code for a criminal operation, but \"admitted that he continued working for the LockBit group, in sum and substance, 'for the money.'\" ®\n",

            "Text: The US Department of Justice has unsealed charges against Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, suspected of being a developer for the LockBit ransomware group. Panev was arrested in August 2024 and is currently in custody in Israel pending extradition. The charges “According to the superseding complaint, documents filed in this and related cases, and statements made in court, Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024,” the US DoJ says. “During that time, Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world.” Panev is charged for being a core member of the LockBit ransomware-as-a-service outfit, designing the LockBit malware code and maintaining the infrastructure on which LockBit operated. The criminal complaint says that at the time of Panev’s arrest, Israeli law enforcement found on his computer: Administrator credentials for a dark web online repository, where source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder were stored, along with source code for LockBit’s StealBit data exfiltration tool Access credentials for the LockBit control panel, an online dashboard maintained by LockBit developers for LockBit’s affiliates The complaint also alleges that Panev was in contact with Lockbit’s alleged primary administrator- Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, aka LockBitSupp – and discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel. “In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work, consistent with the transfers identified by U.S. authorities,” the DoJ added . “Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network. Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group.” Panev faces 41 counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer computer, and extortion. LockBit victims and arrests of affiliates The LockBit group and its affiliates attacked 2,500+ victims (both individuals and organizations) around the world, the DoJ says. 1,800 of those victims are located in the US. The criminal complaint holds details about the impact of the attacks on some of the (unnamed) victims, including “Victim-12, a major financial institution based in China with operations in New York and New Jersey” that’s probably the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which was hit by LockBit in 2023. That specific victim organization ended up paying a ransom of approximately $449,075, according to the complaint, and the LockBit gang previously claimed that ICBC paid the ransom. “Victim-11, a multinational aeronautical and defense corporation headquartered in Virginia” that was hit in late October 2023 and did not pay the ransom is likely Boeing . All in all, the DoJ estimates that “LockBit’s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery.” LockBit’s operations were disrupted by an international law enforcement task force in February 2024. A number of suspected LockBit affiliates have been arrested, charged and/or sentenced since then , and they group’s suspected leader was unmasked in May.\n",

Ascension owns 140 hospitals and scores of assisted living facilities. In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused mass disruptions as staff was forced to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.

Data stolen depended on the particular person but included individuals' names and medical information (e.g., medical record numbers, dates of service, types of lab tests, or procedure codes), payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account numbers), insurance information (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare ID, policy number, or insurance claim), government identification (e.g., Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver’s license numbers, or passport numbers), and other personal information (such as date of birth or address).\n",
