The said victim, a Brazilian subsidiary of a New Jersey-based company, had its computers breached by the defendant, who then exploited the access to steal confidential customer information from about 300,000 customers on at least three occasions.

A month later, the defendant forwarded the aforementioned message to both the CEO and an executive working in the Brazilian subsidiary. In one of the follow-up messages sent to a representative of the company, De Oliveira said he \"very interested in helping you guys solve this security flaw\" but said it will incur a consulting fee of 75 bitcoin (about $800,000 at the time).

For attackers, the approach is ruthlessly efficient, but for compromised institutions—and the individuals they serve—the malicious rampages had very real consequences for people's privacy, safety, and security. As political turmoil and social unrest intensify around the world, 2025 will be a complicated—and potentially explosive—year in cyberspace. But first, here's WIRED's look back on this year's worst breaches, leaks, state-sponsored hacking campaigns, ransomware attacks, and digital extortion cases. Stay alert, and stay safe out there. China's Salt Typhoon Telecom Breaches Espionage operations are a fact of life, and relentless Chinese campaigns have been a constant in cyberspace for years now. But the China-linked espionage group Salt Typhoon carried out a particularly noteworthy operation this year, infiltrating a slew of US telecoms including Verizon and AT&amp;T (plus others around the world) for months. And US officials told reporters earlier this month that many victim companies are still actively attempting to remove the hackers from their networks. The attackers surveilled a small group of people—less than 150 by current count—but they include individuals who were already subject to US wiretap orders as well as state department officials and members of both the Trump and Harris presidential campaigns. Additionally, texts and calls from other people who interacted with the Salt Typhoon targets were inherently also caught up in the espionage scheme. Snowflake Customer Breaches Throughout the summer, attackers were on a tear, breaching prominent companies and organizations that were all customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. The spree barely qualifies as hacking, since cybercriminals were simply using stolen passwords to log in to Snowflake accounts that didn't have two-factor authentication turned on. The end result, though, was an extraordinary amount of data stolen from victims including Ticketmaster, Santander Bank, and Neiman Marcus. Another prominent victim, the telecom giant AT&amp;T, said in July that “nearly all” records relating to its customers' calls and texts from a seven-month stretch in 2022 were stolen in a Snowflake-related intrusion. The security firm Mandiant, which is owned by Google, said in June that the rampage impacted roughly 165 victims. In July, Snowflake added a feature so account administrators could make two-factor authentication mandatory for all of their users. In November, suspect Alexander “Connor” Moucka was arrested by Canadian law enforcement for allegedly leading the hacking spree . He was indicted by the US Department of Justice for the Snowflake tear and faces extradition to the US. John Erin Binns , who was arrested in Turkey for an indictment related to a 2021 breach of the telecom T-Mobile, was also indicted on charges related to the Snowflake customer breaches. Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack At the end of February, the medical billing and insurance processing company Change Healthcare was hit with a ransomware attack that caused disruptions at hospitals, doctor's offices, pharmacies, and other health care facilities around the US. The attack is one of the all-time largest breaches of medical data, impacting more than 100 million people. The company, which is owned by UnitedHealth, is a dominant medical billing processor in the US. It said days after the attack started that it believed ALPHV/BlackCat, a notorious Russian-speaking ransomware gang, was behind the assault. Personal data stolen in the attack included patient phone numbers, addresses, banking and other financial information, and health records including diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment details. The company paid a $22 million ransom to ALPHV/BlackCat at the beginning of March in an attempt to contain the situation. The payment seemingly emboldened attackers to hit health care targets at an even greater rate than usual. With ongoing, rolling notifications to more than 100 million victims—with more still being discovered—lawsuits and other blowback has been mounting. This month, for example, the state of Nebraska sued Change Healthcare , alleging that “failures to implement basic security protections” made the attack much worse than it should have been. Russia's Midnight Blizzard Hit Microsoft Microsoft said in January that it had been breached by Russia's “Midnight Blizzard” hackers in an incident that compromised company executives' email accounts. The group is tied to the Kremlin's SVR foreign intelligence agency and is specifically linked to SVR's APT 29, also known as Cozy Bear. After an initial intrusion in November 2023, the attackers targeted and compromised historic Microsoft system test accounts that then allowed them to access what the company said were “a very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions.” From there, the group exfiltrated “some emails and attached documents.” Microsoft said that the attackers seemed to be looking for information about what the company knew about them—in other words, Midnight Blizzard doing reconnaissance on Microsoft's research into the group. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) also said in January that it had suffered a corporate email breach attributed to Midnight Blizzard. National Public Data The background check company National Public Data suffered a breach in December 2023, and data from the incident started showing up for sale on cybercriminal forums in April 2024. Different configurations of the data cropped up again and again over the summer, culminating in public confirmation of the breach by the company in August. The stolen data included names, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. Since National Public Data didn't confirm the breach until August, speculation about the situation grew for months and included theories that the data included tens or even hundreds of millions of Social Security numbers. Though the breach was significant, the true number of impacted individuals seems to be, mercifully, much lower. The company reported in a filing to officials in Maine that the breach affected 1.3 million people. In October, National Public Data's parent company, Jerico Pictures, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the Southern District of Florida, citing state and federal investigations into the breach as well as a number of lawsuits that the company is facing over the incident. Honorable Mention: North Korean Cryptocurrency Theft A lot of people steal a lot of cryptocurrency every year, including North Korean cybercriminals who have a mandate to help fund the hermit kingdom. A report from the cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis released this month, though, underscores just how aggressive Pyongyang-backed hackers have become. The researchers found that in 2023, hackers affiliated with North Korea stole more than $660 million across 20 attacks. This year, they stole roughly $1.34 billion across 47 incidents. The 2024 figures represent 20 percent of total incidents Chainalysis tracked for the year and a whopping 61 percent of the total funds stolen by all actors. The sheer domination is impressive, but the researchers emphasize the seriousness of the crimes. “US and international officials have assessed that Pyongyang uses the crypto it steals to finance its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles programs, endangering international security,” Chainalysis wrote.\", highlights=[\"The stolen data included names, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth. Since National Public Data didn't confirm the breach until August, speculation about the situation grew for months and included theories that the data included tens or even hundreds of millions of Social Security numbers. Though the breach was significant, the true number of impacted individuals seems to be, mercifully, much lower. The company reported in a filing to officials in Maine that the breach affected 1.3 million people. In October, National Public Data's parent company, Jerico Pictures, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the Southern District of Florida, citing state and federal investigations into the breach as well as a number of lawsuits that the company is facing over the incident.\"], highlight_scores=[0.5770066380500793], summary=None), Result(url='https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/26/hacker-hijacks-15-accounts-on-x-launches-memecoin-scams-and-steals-500000-in-one-month-blockchain-investigator/', id='https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/26/hacker-hijacks-15-accounts-on-x-launches-memecoin-scams-and-steals-500000-in-one-month-blockchain-investigator/', title='Hacker Hijacks 15 Accounts on X, Launches Memecoin Scams and Steals $500,000 in One Month: Blockchain Investigator', score=0.134294331073761, published_date='2024-12-26T00:00:00.000Z', author='Rhodilee Jean Dolor', image='https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/account-breach-hack.jpg', favicon='https://dailyhodl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-TDHLds.png?w=32', subpages=None, extras=None, text=\"A pseudonymous on-chain investigator says he’s unraveling a malicious scheme that’s using hacked accounts on the social media platform X to promote a fake memecoin. ZachXBT says the cybercriminal stole the credentials of high-profile X accounts by sending phishing emails that impersonated the X team. The emails appear as a notice of policy and guideline violations from X to create a sense of urgency and get the recipients to click a malicious link. “A threat actor has stolen ~$500K over the past month by compromising 15+ X accounts (Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, Brett, etc). Each of the 15 ATOs were directly connected by mapping out the deployer address for each scam. The attacker bridged back and forth between Solana and Ethereum in an attempt to obfuscate the funding source.” Source: ZachXBT/X According to smart contract platform Neutron, the bad actor sent fake copyright infringement emails that told the targeted X users to reset their password and two-factor authentication (2FA) by visiting what turned out to be a phishing site. Once the X account is compromised, the attacker logs out all sessions, changes security settings and then controls posting access to share malicious links that promote a scam token.

A children’s hospital, Boeing, the UK’s Royal Mail, and sandwich chain Subway have all been recent victims.\\nBut LockBit’s hacking campaign has come to a juddering halt. A sweeping law enforcement operation, led by police at the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) and involving investigators from 10 forces around the world, has infiltrated the ransomware group and taken its systems offline.\\nGraeme Biggar, the director general of the NCA, says the group has been “fundamentally disrupted.” The law enforcement operation, called Operation Cronos, has taken control of LockBit's infrastructure and administration system, seized its dark-web leak site, accessed its source code, seized around 11,000 domains and servers, and obtained details of the group's members. “As of today, LockBit is effectively redundant,” Biggar said at a press conference in London, appearing with law enforcement officials from the FBI and Europol. “We have hacked the hackers,” he says.\\nThe action is one of the largest and potentially most significant ever taken against a cybercrime group. Biggar says the law enforcement officials consider LockBit, which is global in nature, to have been the “most prolific and harmful” ransomware group that has been active in recent years. It was responsible for 25 percent of attacks in the past year. “LockBit ransomware has caused losses of billions,” Biggar says of the overall costs of attacks and recovery.\\nIn addition to the seizing of technical infrastructure, the law enforcement operations around LockBit also include arrests in Poland, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as sanctions for two alleged members of the group who are based in Russia. The group has members spread around the world, the officials said.\\nNicole Argentieri, acting assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice, says LockBit has received more than $120 million in ransomware payments, and that the action announced against the group is just the start of the clampdowns.\\nThe law enforcement action against LockBit was first revealed when its ransomware website dropped offline on February 19 and was replaced by a holding page saying it had been seized by police. The LockBit group, which debuted as “ABCD” before changing its name, first appeared at the end of 2019. Since then, LockBit has rapidly attacked businesses and grown its name recognition within the cybercrime ecosystem. “LockBit has been a thorn in the side of businesses and governments for years, with well over 3,000 publicly known victims, and [has been] seemingly untouchable,” says Allan Liska, an analyst specializing in ransomware for cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Lockbit’s long roster of victims include various US government organizations, ports, and automotive companies.\\nLockBit operates as a ransomware-as-a-service operation, with a core handful of members creating its malware and running its website and infrastructure. This core group licenses its code to “affiliates,” who launch attacks against companies, steal their data, and try to extort money from them. “LockBit is the last of the ‘open affiliate’ ransomware-as-a-service offerings, meaning anyone willing to cough up the cash can join their program with little or no vetting,” Liska says. “They likely have had hundreds of affiliates over the course of their run.”\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nLockBit affiliates have demanded millions of dollars from companies they hack—in one instance asking for $60 million from a car dealer based in the UK and recently setting a $800,000 ransom for a nonprofit hospital. If companies refuse to pay, their data is published online. Earlier this month, LockBit posted 43 GB of data allegedly stolen from defense firm Boeing. Cybersecurity firm Secureworks, which has published a new analysis of the group, says LockBit’s leadership “ceded control to its affiliates” and essentially had “little oversight over affiliates’ actions or choice of victims.” This approach allowed the group to grow quickly but also added an “element of chaos” into its actions, according to Secureworks.\\n“\\u200b\\u200bThey are quite indiscriminate in their targeting,” says Brett Callow, a threat analyst at antivirus company Emsisoft. The police action is likely to be the “most significant ransomware disruption” against a ransomware group to date, Callow says. He says the group has had a “cockroach-like resilience” since it was created, and that the law enforcement action is likely to send “shockwaves” through the largely Russian ransomware ecosystem. “Anybody who collaborated with LockBit will be concerned that law enforcement are now in possession of info that will point to them.\\nAs part of the law enforcement operation, officials say they have obtained a huge trove of information about the operation of LockBit and who its members may be. More than 200 cryptocurrency wallets linked to the group have been seized. Also within the gathered information is company data from ransomware attacks where victims have paid a ransom to LockBit, according to the NCA. “Even when a ransom is paid, it does not guarantee that data will be deleted, despite what the criminals have promised,” the police force says. The law enforcement bodies involved in the takedown have also obtained decryption keys for companies and organizations that have had their data locked but not paid to regain access.\\nJon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at Analyst1 who has studied the group for years and been in constant contact with its leadership, says LockBit stands out from other cybercrime groups due to its “disciplined” and professionalized nature. The ransomware group has issued updates to its malware and encryption technologies multiple times and tried to stay under the radar, compared to other ransomware groups which have bragged about their activities.\\nDiMaggio says the leader of LockBit, who uses the online persona LockBitSupp, appears not to have been a technically skilled hacker themselves but more likely had a “background” in running a business and handling money. “They literally [ran] it like it was a legitimate business,” DiMaggio says, adding that the group has strictly controlled the systems its core members use to communicate and that LockBitSupp appears to have been skilled in their operational security.\\nHowever, LockBit has also fallen into some boasting and grandstanding. The group organized an essay writing competition on a Russian-language cybercrime forum, with paid prizes for the winners. The most bizarre incident happened in September 2022 when the group offered to pay $1,000 to anyone who got a tattoo of its logo. Around 20 people posted photos and videos of tattoos on their arms, legs, wrists, and more. The group has also offered a bounty of $10 million if someone successfully found and published the real name of the person behind LockBitSupp.\\nMorgan Meaker\\nChris Baraniuk\\nStephen Armstrong\\nLouryn Strampe\\nAs part of the operation against LockBit, law enforcement officials have repurposed the group's own leak website where it published information about victims. The website now displays—in the style of LockBit—links to the police press release, sanctions, and ransomware recovery tools. Officials say they are planning to publish more information about the group and its activities every day. One icon on the seized LockBit website teases that the identity of LockBitSupp may be revealed this week.\\nThe takedown of LockBit comes as law enforcement agencies around the world have taken a progressively more aggressive approach to cybercrime groups in recent years. Police forces and even military hacking groups have successfully taken operations offline, in some cases claiming to create and share decryption keys to unlock encrypted files. These actions have often been accompanied by sanctions and indictments for key members of the cybercrime underground. The result has been a splintering of the cybercrime ecosystem with large-scale ransomware groups such as Conti and Trickbot breaking up, and some of their members reforming as smaller, less effective ransomware groups.\\nThe takedown operation has—for the time being, at least—stopped one of the most long-lasting, notorious, and persistent ransomware groups. But it comes as payments to ransomware groups have hit record highs, and the threat to businesses remains prolific. Data released by cryptocurrency-tracing firm Chainalysis at the start of February revealed that across the whole of 2023, ransomware payments exceeded more than $1.1 billion—the highest they’ve ever been. Many criminals are also based in Russia, which has largely turned a blind eye to their actions and very rarely extradites those wanted abroad.\\nWhile the LockBit takedown is significant, it may be only temporary. Previous ransomware groups have reformed as new brands and continued their hacking and extortion. “Disruption of the LockBit ransomware service would seriously slow down the number of ransomware attacks, even though it might be temporary,” Recorded Future’s Liska says.\\nPerhaps more than anything else, the takedown is likely to send a message to LockBit’s affiliates and act as a sign that the group’s brand is tainted. A screenshot shared by cybersecurity research website VX-Underground appears to show a message received by LockBit affiliates trying to log in to its systems: “We have source code, details of the victims you have attacked, the amount of money extorted, the data stolen, chats, and much, much more. You can thank LockbitSupp and their flawed infrastructure for this situation … we may be in touch with you very soon.”\\nIn recent weeks, DiMaggio says, the LockBitSupp administrator has been behaving more erratically after being banned from two prominent Russian hacking forums. However, DiMaggio believes they may try to bring the group back under the same name. “The guy’s ego is so big and he’s so attached to that brand, I truly do not think that he will rebrand,” DiMaggio says. “Hopefully, it’ll be a watered-down version, and hopefully the real elite affiliates that now work for him will be concerned about working for him again.”\\nUpdated: 2/20/2024, 9:28 am EST: This story has been updated with more details about the takedown of LockBit.\\nAndy Greenberg\\nMatt Burgess\\nAndrew Couts\\nAndy Greenberg\\nAndy Greenberg\\nWilliam Turton\\nNicole Tisdale\\nKate O'Flaherty\\nMore From WIRED\\nReviews and Guides\\n© 2024 Condé Nast.

Ryzhenkov additionally has been linked to the alias mx1r and associated with UNC2165 (an evolution of Evil Corp affiliated actors).”\\n\\nIn May we revealed LockBitsUpp, leader of the LockBit ransomware group, as Dmitry Khoroshev. Today, we can also identify one of his affiliates (known as Beverley) as Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Russian national and key member of cyber criminal group, Evil Corp. pic.twitter.com/SW524RhtiR\\n— National Crime Agency (NCA) (@NCA_UK) October 1, 2024\\n\\nRyzhenkov is also believed to be the right-hand man of Maksim Yakubets, Evil Corp’s founder and leader, better known as Aqua. Yakubets currently has a US$5 million bounty for his arrest.\\nFor their involvement in the cyber gang, 16 Evil Corp members, including Rhyzenkov, have had sanctions imposed on them by the UK. The US imposed seven and Australia imposed three, with both countries placing sanctions on Ryzhenkov.\\nAdditionally, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) imposed a sanction on Ryzhenkov for “using the BitPaymer ransomware variant to attack numerous victims in Texas and throughout the United States and hold their sensitive data for ransom”.\\nBitPaymer is a ransomware variant used by Ryzhenkov and other threat actors to encrypt files on accessed devices.\\nHaving tracked Evil Corp since 2010, major cyber security firm CrowdStrike said it worked with global law enforcement and provided critical threat intelligence and analysis “in support” of the latest announcements.\\n“CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations has tracked INDRIK SPIDER (aka Evil Corp) since 2010. Throughout its tenure, the adversary has developed the Dridex banking Trojan and several ransomware variants, including BitPaymer and WastedLocker,” it said.\\nAccording to the US DOJ, Ryzhenkov would gain unauthorised access to victim devices before deploying BitPaymer. He would then leave a digital ransomware note that contained a ransom demand as well as instructions on how to contact the threat group and pay the ransom.\\n“The Justice Department is using all the tools at its disposal to attack the ransomware threat from every angle,” said Deputy Attorney-General Lisa Monaco.\\n“Today’s charges against Ryzhenkov detail how he and his conspirators stole the sensitive data of innocent Americans and then demanded ransom.\\n“With law enforcement partners here and around the world, we will continue to put victims first and show these criminals that, in the end, they will be the ones paying for their crimes.”\\nLockBit’s reactivated seized leak site will once again be taken down by law enforcement in under a week.\\nThe latest activity was achieved thanks to collaboration between law enforcement agencies from Australia, the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Japan, Switzerland, Romania, and the Netherlands, alongside the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust).\\nLockBit’s dark web leak site was first seized in February this year, with law enforcement taking over the group’s administration environment, arresting two individuals and indicting five others.\\nLike the latest activity, Operation Cronos agencies announced this activity on LockBit’s own site.\\n\\nDaniel Croft\\nBorn in the heart of Western Sydney, Daniel Croft is a passionate journalist with an understanding for and experience writing in the technology space.

The latest development in the ongoing battle against cybercrime sees LockBit seizure by law enforcement authorities and the taking down of the 22 data leak websites associated with the threat actor.\\nUsers attempting to access the LockBit site are now met with a message indicating its takeover by the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), working in tandem with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, Operation Cronos. This joint operation marks a milestone in the fight against cyber threats, particularly those posed by ransomware groups like LockBit.\\nYou might also like\\nVMware Highlights Critical Flaws in Enhanced Authentication Plug-in (EAP)\\nNavigating the Maze: Tips to Consider When Choosing SOC as a Service\\nNSA Cyber Director Rob Joyce Retires After 34 Years of Service\\nHowever, the threat actor seems to have taken a sophisticated turn and has released a notification letter about the LockBit takedown, notifying the users about the incident and the next set of steps it is going to take.\\nThe LockBit Domain Takedown: Details About the ‘Operation Cronos’\\nThe LockBit takedown operation, involving law enforcement agencies from 11 different countries, has resulted in the seizure of 11,000 domains associated with LockBit and its affiliates. This move aims to disrupt the group’s infrastructure and dismantle its ransomware deployment system, a critical step in curbing its nefarious activities.\\nUpon accessing the website, instead of the usual data breach content, users can now see the message, “This site is now under the control of The National Crime Agency of the UK, working in close cooperation with the FBI and the international law enforcement task force, ‘Operation Cronos’, being displayed on the screen.\\nThe LockBit ransomware group is notorious for encrypting files on victims’ computers and demanding payment for their release, a practice that has caused havoc across various sectors globally. Affiliates recruited by LockBit employ the group’s tools and infrastructure to carry out these attacks, with LockBit taking a share of the ransom proceeds.\\nParticipating countries in this coordinated action include Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Finland, demonstrating the international scale of the effort against cybercrime.\\nThe Technical Side of the LockBit Seizure: Multiple Facets\\nLaw enforcement agencies, including EUROPOL, the FBI, the National Crime Agency of the UK, and the Operation Cronos Law Enforcement Task Force, have initiated the LockBit takedown with at least 22 Tor sites associated with Lockbit have been affected in what is termed ‘Operation Cronos.’\\nNotifications on the seized websites read, “Hello Law Enforcement has taken control of Lockbit’s platform and obtained all the information held on there. This information relates to the Lockbit group and you, their affiliate.”\\nThe Lockbit ransomware group’s administrative staff confirmed the seizure, with messages disseminated via Tox and other channels, citing the compromise of their servers through a PHP vulnerability (CVE-2023-3824), reported vx-underground on X (previously Twitter)\\nAffiliates attempting to access the LockBit panel are greeted with notices indicating law enforcement control over the platform, with warnings of extensive data acquisition, including victim details, extortion amounts, stolen data, chats, and more.\\nThe compromise is attributed to the exploitation of the aforementioned PHP vulnerability, leading to memory corruption or remote code execution. This coordinated effort by law enforcement agencies highlights their commitment to combating cybercrime and disrupting ransomware operations.\\nThe Response to LockBit Takedown\\nIn response to the LockBit seizure, the ransomware group has shared a letter through a mass broadcast on Tox. A notification letter, titled “Important Security Notice from Lockbit – Action Required,” was disseminated to affiliates outlining the situation. The letter highlights the unauthorized access detected by LockBit’s team, allegedly perpetrated by the NCA group.\\nThe breach potentially compromised personal data such as names, email addresses, and encrypted passwords, though no evidence suggests access to financial information or social security numbers. In response, LockBit has heightened security measures, initiated an investigation with “operators and cybercriminals”, and offered affected individuals 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring.\\nAffiliates are advised to reset passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and monitor accounts for any suspicious activities. For further assistance, individuals are directed to contact LockBit’s customer support through email and phone.\\nThe Impact of LockBit Ransomware Group\\nLockBit’s impact has been felt worldwide, with statistics revealing its prominence in ransomware incidents across different regions. According to CISA, In Australia, for instance, LockBit accounted for 18% of reported ransomware incidents from April 2022 to March 2023, while in Canada, it was responsible for 22% of such incidents in 2022.\\nNew Zealand reported 15 instances of LockBit ransomware in 2022, representing 23% of all ransomware reports received by CERT NZ. Similarly, in the United States, LockBit attacks accounted for 16% of ransomware incidents affecting state, local, tribal, and tribunal governments in 2022. LockBit’s rise to infamy as one of the most deployed ransomware variants highlights the need for international cooperation in combating cyber threats.\\nThe recent takedown operation marks a significant victory in this ongoing battle, but it also highlights the continued challenges posed by ransomware groups operating with impunity on the internet. As law enforcement agencies continue their efforts to dismantle such criminal networks, cybersecurity remains a pressing concern for organizations worldwide.\\nMedia Disclaimer: This report is based on internal and external research obtained through various means.

Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat.\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international partners, hereafter referred to as “authoring organizations,” are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended mitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization’s defenses against this ransomware operation.\\nThe authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents.\\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 13.1. See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for tables of LockBit’s activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques.\\nThe LockBit RaaS and its affiliates have negatively impacted organizations, both large and small, across the world. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group maintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant to individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as “affiliates”), and supports affiliates’ deployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits, or a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. Some of the methods LockBit has used to successfully attract affiliates include, but are not limited to:\\nLockBit has been successful through innovation and ongoing development of the group’s administrative panel and the RaaS supporting functions. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit and other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing ransomware.\\nTable 1 shows LockBit RaaS’s innovation and development.\\nTable 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS\\nDate\\nEvent\\nSeptember 2019\\nFirst observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor to LockBit.

In about 13% of those cases, ANSSI was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of its constituents’ networks – as the alerts were related to the threat actor’s online claims. So far, 69 confirmed incidents have been handled by ANSSI. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall ransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR).\\nTable 2: ANSSI-Observed LockBit vs. Overall Ransomware Activity\\nYear\\nNumber of Incidents\\nPercentage of CERT-FR’s Ransomware-Related Activity\\n2020 (from July)\\n4\\n2%\\n2021\\n20\\n10%\\n2022\\n30\\n27%\\n2023\\n15\\n27%\\nTotal (2020-2023)\\n69\\n11%\\nTable 3 shows the number of instances different LockBit strains were observed by ANSSI from July 2020 to present.\\nTable 3: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strain and Number of Instances\\nName of the Strain*\\nNumber of Instances\\nLockBit 2.0 (LockBit Red)\\n26\\nLockBit 3.0 (LockBit Black)\\n23\\nLockBit\\n21\\nLockBit Green\\n1\\nLockBit (pre-encryption)\\n1\\nTotal\\n72**\\nFigure 1: ANSSI-Observed LockBit Strains by Year\\nFrom the incidents handled, ANSSI can infer that LockBit 3.0 widely took over from LockBit 2.0 and the original LockBit strain from 2022. In two cases, victims were infected with as many as three different strains of LockBit (LockBit 2.0/Red, LockBit 3.0/Black, and LockBit Green).\\nThe authoring agencies observe data leak sites, where attackers publish the names and captured data of victims if they do not pay ransom or hush money. Additionally, these sites can be used to record alleged victims who have been threatened with a data leak. The term 'victims' may include those who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack having taken place).\\nThe leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates’ victims subjected to secondary extortion. Since 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then exfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Because LockBit only reveals the names and leaked data of victims who refuse to pay the primary ransom to decrypt their data, some LockBit victims may never be named or have their exfiltrated data posted on leak sites. As a result, the leak sites reveal a portion of LockBit affiliates’ total victims. For these reasons, the leak sites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data publication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware attacks.\\nUp to the Q1 2023, a total of 1,653 alleged victims were observed on LockBit leak sites. With the introduction of LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0, the leak sites have changed, with some sources choosing to differentiate leak sites by LockBit versions and others ignoring any differentiation. Over time, and through different evolutions of LockBit, the address and layout of LockBit leak sites have changed and are aggregated under the common denominator of the LockBit name. The introduction of LockBit 2.0 at the end of the Q2 2021 had an immediate impact on the cybercriminal market due to multiple RaaS operations shutting down in May and June 2021 (e.g., DarkSide and Avaddon). LockBit competed with other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020. Figure 2 shows the alleged number of victims worldwide on LockBit leak sites starting in Q3 2020.\\nFigure 2: Alleged Number of Victims Worldwide on LockBit Leak Sites\\nDuring their intrusions, LockBit affiliates have been observed using various freeware and open-source tools that are intended for legal use. When repurposed by LockBit, these tools are then used for a range of malicious cyber activity, such as network reconnaissance, remote access and tunneling, credential dumping, and file exfiltration. Use of PowerShell and batch scripts are observed across most intrusions, which focus on system discovery, reconnaissance, password/credential hunting, and privilege escalation. Artifacts of professional penetration-testing tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike have also been observed.\\nTable 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed for ransomware operations. The legitimate freeware and open-source tools mentioned in this product are all publicly available and legal. The use of these tools by a threat actor should not be attributed to the freeware and open-source tools, absent specific articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.\\nTable 4: Freeware and Open-Source Tools Used by LockBit Affiliates\\nTool\\nIntended Use\\nRepurposed Use by LockBit Affiliates\\nMITRE ATT&CK ID\\n7-zip\\nCompresses

unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, as well as newer vulnerabilities such as:\\nLockBit affiliates have been documented exploiting numerous CVEs, including:\\nFor further information on these CVEs, see CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog.\\nWhen LockBit affiliates target an organization responsible for managing other organizations’ networks, CERT NZ has observed LockBit affiliates attempt secondary ransomware extortion after detonation of the LockBit variant on the primary target. Once the primary target is hit, LockBit affiliates then attempt to extort the companies that are customers of the primary target. This extortion is in the form of secondary ransomware that locks down services those customers consume. Additionally, the primary target’s customers may be extorted by LockBit affiliates threatening to release those customers’ sensitive information.\\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques\\nTables 5-16 show the LockBit affiliate tactics and techniques referenced in this advisory.\\nTable 5: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Initial Access\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nDrive-by Compromise\\nT1189\\nLockBit affiliates gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.\\nExploit Public-Facing Application\\nT1190\\nLockBit affiliates may exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell) in internet-facing systems to gain access to victims’ systems.\\nExternal Remote Services\\nT1133\\nLockBit affiliates exploit RDP to gain access to victims’ networks.\\nPhishing\\nT1566\\nLockBit affiliates use phishing and spearphishing to gain access to victims' networks.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining initial access.\\nTable 6: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Execution\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nExecution\\nTA0002\\nLockBit 3.0 launches commands during its execution.\\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\\nT1059.003\\nLockBit affiliates use batch scripts to execute malicious commands.\\nSoftware Deployment Tools\\nT1072\\nLockBit affiliates may use Chocolatey, a command-line package manager for Windows.\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nSystem Services: Service Execution\\nT1569.002\\nLockBit 3.0 uses PsExec to execute commands or payloads.\\nTable 7: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Persistence\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nBoot or Logon Autostart Execution\\nT1547\\nLockBit affiliates enables automatic logon for persistence.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates may use a compromised user account to maintain persistence on the target network.\\nTable 8: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Privilege Escalation\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nPrivilege Escalation\\nTA0004\\nLockBit affiliates will attempt to escalate to the required privileges if current account privileges are insufficient.\\nAbuse Elevation Control Mechanism\\nT1548\\nLockBit affiliates may use ucmDccwCOM Method in UACMe, a GitHub collection of User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques.\\nBoot or Logon Autostart Execution\\nT1547\\nLockBit affiliates enable automatic logon for privilege escalation.\\nDomain Policy Modification: Group Policy Modification\\nT1484.001\\nLockBit affiliates may create Group Policy for lateral movement and can force group policy updates.\\nValid Accounts\\nT1078\\nLockBit affiliates may use a compromised user account to escalate privileges on a victim’s network.\\nTable 9: LockBit Affiliates’ ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Defense Evasion\\nTechnique Title\\nID\\nUse\\nExecution Guardrails: Environmental Keying\\nT1480.001\\nLockBit 3.0 will only decrypt the main component or continue to decrypt and/or decompress data if the correct password is entered.\\nImpair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\\nT1562.001\\nLockBit 3.0 affiliates use Backstab, Defender Control, GMER, PCHunter, PowerTool, Process Hacker or TDSSKiller to disable EDR processes and services.\\nLockBit 3.0 affiliates use Bat Armor to bypass the PowerShell execution Policy.\\nLockBit affiliates may deploy a batch script, 123.bat, to disable and uninstall antivirus software.\\nLockbit 3.0 may modify and/or disable security tools including EDR and antivirus to avoid possible detection of malware, tools, and activities.\\nIndicator Removal: Clear Windows Event Logs\\nT1070.001\\nLockBit executable clears the Windows Event Logs files.\\nIndicator Removal: File Deletion\\nT1070.004\\nLockBit 3.0 will delete itself from the disk.\\nObfuscated Files or Information\\nT1027\\nLockBit 3.0 will send encrypted host and bot information to its command and control (C2) servers.\\nObfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\\nT1027.002\\nLockBit affiliates may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code.

These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.\\nThe listed mitigations are ordered by MITRE ATT&CK tactic. Mitigations that apply to multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics are listed under the tactic that occurs earliest in an incident’s lifecycle. For example, account use polices are mitigations for initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, and credential access but would be listed under initial access mitigations.\\nImplementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it by applying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond to ransomware before an organization’s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack vectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in this advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack is broken into three phases:\\nFigure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop a ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data. In the Initial Access phase, mitigations working together to deny an attacker network access include securing internet-exposed services, patching devices, implementing MFA, disabling macros, employing application allowlisting, and using logging and alerting. In the Consolidation and Preparation phase, mitigations working together to keep an attacker from accessing network devices are patching devices, using network segmentation, enforcing the principle of least privilege, implementing MFA, and using logging and alerting. Finally, in the Impact on Target phase, mitigations working together to deny or degrade an attacker’s ability to steal and/or encrypt data includes using logging and alerting, using and maintaining backups, and employing application allowlisting.\\nCritical Controls Key\\nFigure 3: Stopping Ransomware Using Layered Mitigations\\nValidate Security Controls\\nIn addition to applying mitigations, the authoring organizations recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&CK techniques described in this advisory.\\nTo get started:\\nThe authoring organizations recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory.\\nResources\\nReporting\\nThe authoring organizations do not encourage paying ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the authoring organizations urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your country’s respective authorities.\\nDisclaimer\\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

When will Lockbit get shut down for good?\\nThe infamous Lockbit ransomware gang is still active and shared data from five cyberattacks this week despite a global law enforcement infiltration last month.\\nLockbit purportedly posted data from five new victims on its dark web site Thursday, according to cybersecurity firm Falcon Feeds. The victims appear to be two US manufacturing firms, a US infrastructure engineering company, a Canadian oil and energy services company, and a British accounting firm.\\nBut Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft, tells PCMag via email that Lockbit is presenting the data as new attacks when, in fact, the ransomware group is just offering new data. \"None of Lockbit’s new postings seem to relate to new incidents. They’re posting data from old attacks, likely in an effort to rehab their rep and convince affiliates and other business partners that all is well (which it isn’t),\" Callow says.\\n\"Because companies often don’t release details of incidents, it’s impossible to say for sure but, until recently, it certainly appeared that they were posting data from old incidents,\" Callow continued.\\nThe US Department of Justice, FBI, as well as the UK\\'s National Crime Agency (NCA) and other agencies involved previously said they had compromised Lockbit\\'s operations. The FBI seized Lockbit\\'s servers, the law enforcement agencies took an estimated 1,000 decryption keys, and the NCA declared it had \"hacked the hackers.\"\\nBut within a week of the news, Lockbit ransomware hackers were back online, claiming to have been able to preserve their backup servers that didn\\'t use PHP, which was reportedly the government agencies\\' means of entry.\\nTwo alleged Lockbit affiliates were arrested in the Ukraine last month, and the US identified two Russian nationals allegedly connected to the ransomware group and called for their arrest. This month, another previously arrested Russian-Canadian Lockbit member was sentenced to four years in prison for infecting over 1,000 victims with Lockbit ransomware.\\nBut the group\\'s activities appear to be ongoing. The supposed anonymous leader of Lockbit claimed in an interview with The Record this week that they are continuing to attack victims and that while some of Lockbit\\'s members got \"scared,\" \"most\" are still working to deploy ransomware attacks.\\n\"The FBI was not able to completely destroy my infrastructure,\" the Lockbit leader said.\\nRecommended by Our Editors\\nThe NCA previously told PCMag that it anticipated Lockbit would try to resurrect itself, and said that it will continue to work to dismantle the group.\\nLockbit\\'s software has been used for attacks against Boeing, dental insurance firms, and Subway. Apple Silicon Mac computers aren\\'t immune, either.\\nEditors\\' Note: This story has been updated to include comment from Callow.\\nLike What You\\'re Reading?\\nSign up for SecurityWatch newsletter for our top privacy and security stories delivered right to your inbox.\\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.
