            "Text: A dual Russian and Israeli national has been charged in the United States for allegedly being the developer of the now-defunct LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation since its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. Rostislav Panev , 51, was arrested in Israel earlier this August and is currently awaiting extradition, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement. Based on fund transfers to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev, he allegedly earned approximately $230,000 between June 2022 and February 2024. \"Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit co-conspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,\" U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger said . LockBit, which was one of the most prolific ransomware groups, had its infrastructure seized in February 2024 as part of an international law enforcement operation called Cronos. It gained notoriety for targeting more than 2,500 entities in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the U.S. alone. Victims of LockBit's attacks included individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, such as hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, government, and law enforcement agencies. The RaaS is believed to have netted the group at least $500 million in illicit profits. Court documents show that Panev's computer analyzed following his arrest had administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and contained source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which affiliates used to create custom builds of the ransomware. Also discovered were access credentials for the LockBit control panel and a tool called StealBit , which allowed the affiliate actors to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised hosts prior to initiating the encryption process. Panev, besides writing and maintaining the LockBit malware code as well as offering technical guidance to the e-crime group, is also accused of exchanging direct messages with Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev , the primary administrator who also went by online alias LockBitSupp, discussing development work related to the builder and control panel. \"In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work,\" the DoJ said. \"Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network.\" With the latest arrest, a total of seven LockBit members – Mikhail Vasiliev , Ruslan Astamirov , Artur Sungatov, Ivan Gennadievich Kondratiev , Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev – have been charged in the U.S. Despite these operational setbacks, the LockBit operators appear to be plotting a comeback , with a new version LockBit 4.0 scheduled for release in February 2025. However, it remains to be seen if the extortion gang can successfully stage a return in light of the ongoing wave of takedowns and charges. Second Netwalker Ransomware Affiliate Gets 20 Years in Prison The development comes as Daniel Christian Hulea, a 30-year-old Romanian affiliate of the NetWalker ransomware operation, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $21,500,000 and his interests in an Indonesian company and a luxury resort property that was financed with ill-gotten proceeds from the attacks. Hulea previously pleaded guilty in the U.S. to charges of computer fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy back in June 2024. He was arrested in Romania on July 11, 2023, and subsequently extradited to the U.S. \"As part of his plea agreement, Hulea admitted to using NetWalker to obtain approximately 1,595 bitcoin in ransom payments for himself and a co-conspirator, valued at approximately $21,500,000 at the time of the payments,\" the DoJ said . The NetWalker ransomware operation particularly singled out the healthcare sector during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was dismantled online in January 2021 when U.S. and Bulgarian authorities seized the dark web sites used by the group. In October 2022, a Canadian affiliate, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Raccoon Stealer Developer Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison In related law enforcement news, the DoJ also announced the sentencing of Mark Sokolovsky, a Ukrainian national accused of being the primary developer of the Raccoon Stealer malware, to 60 months in federal prison for one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. The 28-year-old conspired to offer the Raccoon infostealer as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) to other criminal actors for $200 a month, who then deployed the malware on victims' systems using various ruses such as email phishing in order to steal sensitive data. The harvested information was used to commit financial crimes or sold to others on underground forums. Sokolovsky, who was extradited from the Netherlands in February 2024, pleaded guilty to the crime in early October and agreed to forfeit $23,975 and pay at least $910,844.61 in restitution. \"Mark Sokolovsky was a key player in an international criminal conspiracy that victimized countless individuals by administering malware which made it cheaper and easier for even amateurs to commit complex cybercrimes,\" said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has set up a website where users can check whether their email address shows up in the data stolen by the Raccoon stealer malware. The MaaS operation was taken offline in March 2022 concurrent with Sokolovsky's arrest by Dutch authorities. NYC Man Gets Nearly 6 Years in Prison for Credit Card Trafficking and Money Laundering The latest actions also follow the sentencing of a 32-year-old New York City man, Vitalii Antonenko, to time served plus days for his involvement in a criminal scheme that infiltrated systems with SQL injection attacks in order to steal credit card and personal information and offer the data for sale on online criminal marketplaces. \"Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds in order to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership, and control,\" the DoJ noted in May 2020. \"The conspiracy's victims included a hospitality business and non-profit scientific research institution, both located in eastern Massachusetts.\" Antonenko was arrested in March 2019 on his return to the U.S. from Ukraine carrying \"computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.\" In September 2024, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorized access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

            "Text: WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The United States has charged a Russian-Israeli dual citizen over alleged involvement with the Lockbit ransomware group, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday. Rostislav Panev, 51, was arrested in Israel in August and is awaiting extradition to the United States, the department said. Panev was a developer at Lockbit from its inception some time in 2019 through to at least February 2024, during which time the group grew into \"what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world,\" the DOJ said. \"The Justice Department's work going after the world's most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks, but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Lockbit and its malware were linked to attacks on more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, according to the DOJ, including small businesses and large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, government and law enforcement agencies. Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums. It operated a ransomware-as-a-service operation, where a core group of developers and administrators worked with \"affiliates\" who carried out attacks. Extortion proceeds were split between the parties involved. Lockbit and its affiliates extorted at least $500 million in payments from victims, according to the DOJ, as well as causing significant costs from lost revenue and incident response and recovery. The arrest follows two guilty pleas in July from a pair of Russian members of the Lockbit gang - Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev - and the seizure , in February, of numerous Lockbit websites by Britain's National Crime Agency, the FBI, and other international law enforcement agencies. Lockbit reappeared online not long after the seizure, defiantly saying: \"I cannot be stopped.\" But law enforcement officials and experts say the bust helped damage the gang's standing in the cybercriminal underworld. Government actions \"have proven incredibly effective at dismantling and discrediting\" Lockbit as a brand and bringing the group's volume of attacks down precipitously, said Jeremy Kennelly, a cybersecurity analyst with Google owner Alphabet. Affiliates and others working with the group may have shifted to collaborating with other gangs, Kennelly said, but the crackdown has been \"critical to ensuring that ransomware and extortion are seen as crimes for which there are consequences.\" The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day.

            "Text: Note : A copy of the superseding criminal complaint can be found here . A superseding criminal complaint filed in the District of New Jersey was unsealed today charging a dual Russian and Israeli national for being a developer of the LockBit ransomware group. In August, Rostislav Panev, 51, a dual Russian and Israeli national, was arrested in Israel pursuant to a U.S. provisional arrest request with a view towards extradition to the United States. Panev is currently in custody in Israel pending extradition on the charges in the superseding complaint. “The Justice Department’s work going after the world’s most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks, but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Three of the individuals who we allege are responsible for LockBit’s cyberattacks against thousands of victims are now in custody, and we will continue to work alongside our partners to hold accountable all those who lead and enable ransomware attacks.” “The arrest of Mr. Panev reflects the Department's commitment to using all its tools to combat the ransomware threat,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “We started this year with a coordinated international disruption of LockBit — the most damaging ransomware group in the world. Fast forward to today and three LockBit actors are in custody thanks to the diligence of our investigators and our strong partnerships around the world. This case is a model for ransomware investigations in the years to come.” “The arrest of alleged developer Rostislav Panev is part of the FBI’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and dismantle the LockBit ransomware group, one of the most prolific ransomware variants across the globe,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The LockBit group has targeted both public and private sector victims around the world, including schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, as well as small businesses and multi-national corporations. No matter how hidden or advanced the threat, the FBI remains committed to working with our interagency partners to safeguard the cyber ecosystem and hold accountable those who are responsible for these criminal activities.” “The criminal complaint alleges that Rostislav Panev developed malware and maintained the infrastructure for LockBit, which was once the world’s most destructive ransomware group and attacked thousands of victims, causing billions of dollars in damage,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Along with our domestic and international law enforcement partner actions to dismantle LockBit’s infrastructure, the Criminal Division has disrupted LockBit’s operations by charging seven of its key members (including affiliates, developers, and its administrator) and arresting three of these defendants — including Panev. We are especially grateful for our partnerships with authorities in Europol, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, which show that, when likeminded countries work together, cybercriminals will find it harder to escape justice.” “As alleged by the complaint, Rostislav Panev for years built and maintained the digital weapons that enabled his LockBit coconspirators to wreak havoc and cause billions of dollars in damage around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “But just like the six other LockBit members previously identified and charged by this office and our FBI and Criminal Division partners, Panev could not remain anonymous and avoid justice indefinitely. He must now answer for his crimes. Today’s announcement represents another blow struck by the United States and our international partners against the LockBit organization, and our efforts will continue relentlessly until the group is fully dismantled and its members brought to justice.” According to the superseding complaint, documents filed in this and related cases, and statements made in court, Panev acted as a developer of the LockBit ransomware group from its inception in or around 2019 through at least February 2024. During that time, Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States. Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit’s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery. LockBit’s members comprised “developers,” like Panev, who designed the LockBit malware code and maintained the infrastructure on which LockBit operated. LockBit’s other members, called “affiliates,” carried out LockBit attacks and extorted ransom payments from LockBit victims. LockBit’s developers and affiliates would then split ransom payments extorted from victims. As alleged in the superseding complaint, at the time of Panev’s arrest in Israel in August, law enforcement discovered on Panev’s computer administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and stored source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which allowed LockBit’s affiliates to generate custom builds of the LockBit ransomware malware for particular victims. On that repository, law enforcement also discovered source code for LockBit’s StealBit tool, which helped LockBit affiliates exfiltrate data stolen through LockBit attacks. Law enforcement also discovered access credentials for the LockBit control panel, an online dashboard maintained by LockBit developers for LockBit’s affiliates and hosted by those developers on the dark web. The superseding complaint also alleges that Panev exchanged direct messages through a cybercriminal forum with LockBit’s primary administrator, who, in an indictment unsealed in the District of New Jersey in May, the United States alleged to be Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev (Дмитрий Юрьевич Хорошев), also known as LockBitSupp, LockBit, and putinkrab. In those messages, Panev and the LockBit primary administrator discussed work that needed to be done on the LockBit builder and control panel. Court documents further indicate that, between June 2022 and February 2024, the primary LockBit administrator made a series of transfers of cryptocurrency, laundered through one or more illicit cryptocurrency mixing services, of approximately $10,000 per month to a cryptocurrency wallet owned by Panev. Those transfers amounted to over $230,000 during that period. In interviews with Israeli authorities following his arrest in August, Panev admitted to having performed coding, development, and consulting work for the LockBit group and to having received regular payments in cryptocurrency for that work, consistent with the transfers identified by U.S. authorities. Among the work that Panev admitted to having completed for the LockBit group was the development of code to disable antivirus software; to deploy malware to multiple computers connected to a victim network; and to print the LockBit ransom note to all printers connected to a victim network. Panev also admitted to having written and maintained LockBit malware code and to having provided technical guidance to the LockBit group. The LockBit Investigation The superseding complaint against, and apprehension of, Panev follows a disruption of LockBit ransomware in February by the United Kingdom (U.K.)’s National Crime Agency (NCA)’s Cyber Division, which worked in cooperation with the Justice Department, FBI, and other international law enforcement partners. As previously announced by the Department, authorities disrupted LockBit by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization’s infrastructure and by seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data. That disruption succeeded in greatly diminishing LockBit’s reputation and its ability to attack further victims, as alleged by documents filed in this case. The superseding complaint against Panev also follows charges brought in the District of New Jersey against other LockBit members, including its alleged primary creator, developer, and administrator, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev. An indictment against Khoroshev unsealed in May alleges that Khoroshev began developing LockBit as early as September 2019, continued acting as the group’s administrator through 2024, a role in which Khoroshev recruited new affiliate members, spoke for the group publicly under the alias “LockBitSupp,” and developed and maintained the infrastructure used by affiliates to deploy LockBit attacks. Khoroshev is currently the subject of a reward of up to $10 million through the U.S. Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) Rewards Program, w\n",

Their victims ranged from individuals and small businesses to multinational corporations, including hospitals, schools, nonprofit organizations, critical infrastructure, and government and law-enforcement agencies. LockBit’s members extracted at least $500 million in ransom payments from their victims and caused billions of dollars in other losses, including lost revenue and costs from incident response and recovery.']\n",
