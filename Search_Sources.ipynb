Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums. It operated a ransomware-as-a-service operation, where a core group of developers and administrators worked with \"affiliates\" who carried out attacks. Extortion proceeds were split between the parties involved.\n",

The RaaS is believed to have netted the group at least $500 million in illicit profits. Court documents show that Panev's computer analyzed following his arrest had administrator credentials for an online repository that was hosted on the dark web and contained source code for multiple versions of the LockBit builder, which affiliates used to create custom builds of the ransomware. Also discovered were access credentials for the LockBit control panel and a tool called StealBit , which allowed the affiliate actors to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised hosts prior to initiating the encryption process.\n",
