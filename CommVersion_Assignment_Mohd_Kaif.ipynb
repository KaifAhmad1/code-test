        "RealtyFlow AI: Intelligent Real Estate Chatbot\n",
        "---------------------------------------------\n",
        "A complete implementation of a conversational AI agent for real estate businesses\n",
        "that qualifies leads by collecting necessary information based on whether they\n",
        "want to buy or sell property.\n",
        "\n",
        "**RealtyFlow AI** is an intelligent chatbot designed to streamline initial customer interactions for real estate businesses. Built using LangGraph for state management, Google Gemini for natural language understanding and generation, and FAISS for efficient postcode similarity searching, it guides users through a predefined decision tree to understand their intent (buy/sell), budget, and location preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot automates lead qualification, provides instant responses 24/7, and ensures consistent information gathering, ultimately enhancing agent productivity and improving the customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Core Functionality & Flow**\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot operates based on a structured decision tree:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initial Greeting & Intent Capture:**\n",
        "    *   Bot: \"Home. How may I help you? (e.g., 'I want to buy', 'I'm looking to sell')\"\n",
        "    *   User provides input (e.g., \"I want to buy a house\").\n",
        "    *   **Gemini (Intent Classifier):** Determines if the user wants to \"buy\" or \"sell\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Contact Information Gathering:**\n",
        "    *   Bot: \"Great. Can I get your name?\" -> User provides name.\n",
        "    *   Bot: \"Can I get your phone number?\" -> User provides phone.\n",
        "    *   Bot: \"Can I get your email address?\" -> User provides email.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Path Divergence (Buy vs. Sell):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **If Intent is \"Buy\":**\n",
        "        *   Bot: \"Are you looking for a new home or a re-sale home?\"\n",
        "        *   **Gemini (Buy Type Classifier):** Determines \"new\\_home\" or \"re\\_sale\".\n",
        "        *   Bot: \"What is your budget?\"\n",
        "        *   **Budget Processor Tool:** Parses the budget amount.\n",
        "            *   **Rule (New Home):** If budget < £1,000,000 for a \"new\\_home\", the bot informs the user about the minimum budget and ends the interaction with a referral to call the office.\n",
        "        *   Bot (if budget is sufficient or re-sale): \"Can I know the postcode of your location of interest?\"\n",
        "        *   **Postcode Processor Tool (Exact Match & FAISS):**\n",
        "            *   Checks if the normalized postcode is in the pre-approved list.\n",
        "            *   If not an exact match, FAISS suggests similar valid postcodes.\n",
        "            *   **Rule (New Home, Postcode Not Covered):** Informs the user and ends with a referral.\n",
        "            *   **Rule (Postcode Covered or Re-sale/Sell with Uncovered Postcode):** Proceeds to reassistance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **If Intent is \"Sell\":**\n",
        "        *   (After contact info) Bot: \"What is your postcode?\"\n",
        "        *   **Postcode Processor Tool (Exact Match & FAISS):**\n",
        "            *   Checks eligibility. FAISS suggests similar if no exact match.\n",
        "            *   Proceeds to reassistance regardless of coverage (as per flowchart, only a message change).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Outcome & Reassistance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **If Postcode Covered (for any valid path):**\n",
        "        *   Bot: \"Great! That postcode is covered. I can expect someone to get in touch with you within 24 hours via phone or email. Is there anything else I can help you with? (yes/no)\"\n",
        "    *   **If Postcode NOT Covered (for Sell or Re-sale Buy path):**\n",
        "        *   Bot: \"Sorry, we don't cater to the Post code '{postcode}' that you provided. (Did you perhaps mean {suggestion}?) Please call the office on {phone\\_number} to get help. Is there anything else I can help you with? (yes/no)\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Handling Reassistance Choice:**\n",
        "    *   **Gemini (Yes/No Classifier):** Determines if the user said \"yes\" or \"no\".\n",
        "    *   If \"yes\": Bot: \"Okay, let's start over.\" (Restarts the flow).\n",
        "    *   If \"no\": Bot: \"Thank you for chatting with us. Good bye.\" (Ends conversation).\n",
        "    *   If unclear: Re-prompts for yes/no.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Error/Max Attempts Handling:**\n",
        "    *   If the bot fails to understand an input after 3 attempts, it politely ends the conversation and refers the user to call the office.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Technical Stack & Components**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Orchestration:** `LangGraph` (manages the conversational state and flow between nodes).\n",
        "*   **Language Model (LLM):** `Google Gemini` (via `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` from `langchain-google-genai`) for:\n",
        "    *   Intent classification (buy/sell, new\\_home/re\\_sale, yes/no).\n",
        "    *   Generating conversational responses.\n",
        "*   **Embeddings:** `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` (model: `models/embedding-001`) for converting postcodes into vector representations.\n",
        "*   **Vector Search:** `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for:\n",
        "    *   Building an index of eligible postcode embeddings.\n",
        "    *   Finding the most similar eligible postcodes if a user's input isn't an exact match (useful for typo correction/suggestions).\n",
        "*   **Data Handling:** `pandas` for loading the initial list of eligible postcodes.\n",
        "*   **Core Logic:** Python functions and classes acting as \"tools\" or \"agents\":\n",
        "    *   `IntentClassifierAgent`: Wraps Gemini calls for classification tasks.\n",
        "    *   `BudgetProcessorTool`: Parses budget strings into numerical values.\n",
        "    *   `PostcodeProcessorTool`: Handles exact postcode validation and FAISS-based similarity search.\n",
        "*   **State Management:** A `TypedDict` (`ChatbotState`) holds all relevant information during the conversation (history, extracted details, pending actions).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Usefulness & Problem Solving**\n",
        "\n",
        "**RealtyFlow AI** is particularly useful for:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Real Estate Agencies & Property Developers:** To automate initial customer engagement and lead qualification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In essence, RealtyFlow AI streamlines the top of the sales funnel, enhances agent productivity, improves customer experience, and helps reduce operational costs by acting as an intelligent, automated front-desk for real estate businesses.**"
