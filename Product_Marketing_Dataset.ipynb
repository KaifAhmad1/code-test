        "**Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Product Marketing AI System automatically creates high-quality marketing visuals by processing, enhancing, and refining input images.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Steps:**\n",
        "- **Input & Preprocessing:**  \n",
        "  Users provide a base image (e.g., a background or scene) and a secondary image (e.g., a product or model). The system enhances these images, adjusts resolution and contrast, and generates segmentation masks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context & Prompt Generation:**  \n",
        "  It analyzes the images to extract contextual details and automatically generates a detailed, structured marketing prompt tailored to the product and target audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Image Generation & Refinement:**  \n",
        "  Advanced AI models use the prompt to generate photorealistic marketing images. The system then refines the results based on user feedback to ensure the output meets professional quality standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Quality Evaluation:**  \n",
        "  Final images are evaluated using metrics (such as SSIM, PSNR, and color histograms) to compare them with the original inputs. Additionally, AI-driven feedback helps further improve image quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Applications:**\n",
        "- **Digital Advertising & E-Commerce:**  \n",
        "  Generate stunning visuals for online stores, social media campaigns, and ad banners.\n",
        "- **Branding & Marketing:**  \n",
        "  Enhance and standardize visual branding materials across various industries such as fashion, tech, automotive, and real estate.\n",
        "- **Content Creation:**  \n",
        "  Streamline production of professional digital content for websites, promotions, and digital signage.\n",
        "\n",
        "This system provides a seamless, automated solution for creating visually appealing marketing assets, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency and high quality across all outputs."
